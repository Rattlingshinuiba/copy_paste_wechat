IF DONALD TRUMP had slapped punitive tariffs on all Chinese exports to America, as he promised, he would have started a trade war. Fortunately, the president hesitated, partly because he wants China’s help inthwarting North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. But that is not the end of the story. Tensions over China’s industrial might now threaten the architecture of the global economy. America’s trade representative this week called China an “unprecedented” threat that cannot betamed by existing trade rules. The European Union, worried by a spate of Chinese acquisitions, is drafting stricter rules on foreign investment. And, all the while, China’s strategy for modernising its economy is adding further strain.

川普曾发誓，要对中国所有进口美国商品施加惩罚性关税，假使他真的这么做了，那么他就会发动一场贸易战。好在这位总统犹豫了，部分原因是他需要中国帮助来遏制住朝鲜的核野心。不过故事还没完。中国的工业实力引发的紧张局势威胁着全球经济结构。美国贸易代表本周称中国是个史无前例的威胁，不会为现有的贸易规则所控制。大量中国的收购让欧盟担忧不已，欧盟正起草对境外投资更严格的规定。与此同时，中国的经济现代化战略也加重了紧张局势。
