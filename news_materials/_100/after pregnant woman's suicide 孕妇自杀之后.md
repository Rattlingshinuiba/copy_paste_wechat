Chinese social mediausers are reacting with shock and horror after a heavily pregnant woman killedherself, reportedly after her family refused to let her have acaesarean section.

据报道，一名临产孕妇家属拒绝同意她接受刨宫产手术，之后该孕妇自杀。事件发生后，中国社交媒体用户对此表示震惊和恐慌。

The 26-year-old woman, surnamed Ma, jumpedfrom a hospital window in northern Shaanxi province on 31 August. Thechild she was carrying was also killed.

8月31日，在陕西省，这名年仅26岁的马姓孕妇从医院窗户纵深跳下，其肚中胎儿也随之死亡。

Huo Junwei, a doctor at the YulinNumber One hospital, told China Economic Daily that Ms Ma "left the wardtwice and told her family that the pain was unbearable, and that she wanted acaesarean section, but the family were not willing to allow theprocedure."

榆林第一医院一名医生向中国经济日报透露称该孕妇两次离开病房，告诉家人疼痛难忍，希望接受刨宫产手术，然而家属不接受这种手术。

Her husband, surnamed Yan, denies this,telling Beijing Youth Daily that "we did not disagree to acaesarean".

该孕妇丈夫否认了这种说法，告诉北京青年日报“我们没有不同意刨宫产手术。“

Caesarean sections used to be favoured inChina and were seen as a more advanced and less painful way of delivering achild. But the abolition of the one-child policy in October 2015 has changedthis.

在中国，刨宫产手术曾风靡一时，人们认为这是更为先进，引起更少疼痛的接生手术。然而在2015年10月，独生子女政策得以废除，从此改变了这类手术。

The state and the media are now activelyencouraging parents to try for a second child, and women are being advised tothink twice about having the procedure.

政府和媒体如今积极鼓励父母尝试生二胎，但是又有建议称女性要对此进行三思而后行。

"Women need to consider that if theychoose C-sections for their first birth, it could affect their secondpregnancy," Mao Qun'an, from the official National Health and FamilyPlanning Commission, told the Financial Times in 2016.

女性需要考虑这样一种情况：如果她们第一胎经历了刨宫产，那么这就对第二次孕期产生影响。

Caesarean procedures carry a slightlyhigher risk than natural births, and can cause a ruptured uterus, or alow-lying placenta, both of which risk causing complications for futurepregnancies.  

相比顺产，刨宫产手术显得稍微有风险，并且会导致子宫撕裂或者地位胎盘，这些后果有可能使未来怀孕发生并发症。
