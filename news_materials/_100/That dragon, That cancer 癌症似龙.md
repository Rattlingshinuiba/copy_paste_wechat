## That dragon, That cancer 癌症似龙

The greatest excitement is reserved for immunotherapy, a new approach that has emerged in the past few years. The human immune system is equipped with a set of brakes that cancer cells are able to activate; the first immunotherapy treatment in effect disables the brakes, enabling white blood cells to attack the tumours. It is early days, but in a small subset of patients this mechanism has produced long-term remissions that are tantamount to cures. Well over 1,000 clinical trials of such treatments are under way, targeting a wide range of different cancers. It is even now possible to reprogram immune cells to fight cancer better by editing their genomes; the first such gene therapy was approved for use in America last month.

最振奋人心的还当属几年前就出现过的新方法：免疫治疗。人类免疫系统配备有一套刹车装置，这些装置可由癌细胞来激活。首个免疫治疗实际上就让这些刹车失灵，白细胞才能得以攻击肿瘤。现在还为时尚早，但是该机制在一小组病人当中能产生长期缓解疼痛的作用，这相当于具有治愈效果。远多于1000个此类临床试验治疗正在进行，以各种各样的癌症类型作为目标。此刻，重新改编免疫细胞，编辑其基因组以对抗癌症已成为可能。上个月美国首次这类基因治疗得以批准使用。

Yet cancer sufferers need not wait for the therapies of tomorrow to have a better chance of survival today. Across rich and poor countries, the survivability of cancer varies enormously. Men die at far higher rates than women in some countries; in other countries, at similar levels of development, they do comparably well. The five-year survival rate for a set of three common cancers in America and Canada is above 70%; Germany achieves 64%, whereas Britain manages a mere 52%. Disparities exist within countries, too. America does well in its treatment of cancer overall, but suffers extraordinary inequalities in outcomes. The death rate of black American men from all cancers is 24% higher than it is for white males; breast-cancer death rates among blacks are 42% higher than for whites. A diagnosis in rural America is deadlier than one in its cities.

然而癌症患者不该为了今日有更好机会活下去而去等待明日的治疗。在发达和贫穷国家，癌症患者存活率有很大程度的不同。在一些国家，男人死亡率比女人死亡率高的多：在其他处于差不多发达水平的国家，男女死亡率相对持平。在美国和加拿大，对于三种常见癌症，五年的存活率高于70%；德国达到64%，然而英国就仅到52%。国家之间也是有不同的。美国整体在治疗癌症上做得不错，但是在治疗结果上非常地不对等。从所有癌症来看，美国黑人死亡率比白人男性要高24%；黑人乳腺癌死亡率要比白人高42%。美国农村的一次诊断比在城市中更加致命。
