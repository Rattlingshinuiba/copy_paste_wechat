特朗普总统今日与韩国总统文在寅及日本首相安倍晋三在联大期间举行会晤。

Mr. Trump today meet with moon, President of South Korea, and Japanese Primer Minister Shino Abe during the UN general assembly.

文在寅多次排除对朝鲜采取军事手段，他可能会发现自己成了异类。

Mr.Moon repeatedly rules out military actions on North Korea, and he might finds he has been isolated.

尽管文在寅与安倍晋三并没有太多的共同点，但朝鲜核危机的严重性让他们走到一起，结成了一个不舒服的伙伴关系。

Although Mr. Moon has little in common with Mr. Abe, the two leaders have to work together because of the serious nuclear crisis posed by NK, thus going into a partnership that is unpleasant.

一些韩国人觉得，安倍晋三在利用朝鲜日益增长的威胁来推动他在国内的民主主义议程。

Mr. Abe uses growing threats by NK to speed up his nationalism agenda, some South Koreas said.

他们也想知道，安倍是否在鼓励特朗普政府对朝鲜采取越来越好斗的立场，使局面变得更加不稳定。

They also intend to know if Mr.Abe is encouraging Tramp Administration to become increasingly aggressive on NK, which will turn the situation into chaos.

分析人士称，撇开这些强硬语言，日本也对朝鲜半岛发生军事行动忧心忡忡，那可能会导致一场区域内的核战争。

Aside from these tough speeches, Japan is concerned about military actions, which is likely to descend on the peninsula, that will kindle a tournament of regional nuclear war, analysts said.

他们说，安倍晋三同意华盛顿把所有选择都放在桌面上的说法，是在扮演可靠盟友的角色，同时希望鼓励中国出来缓和朝鲜的行为。

They also said, Mr. Abe, who is consent with Washington that put all options on the table, plays a reliable role to be an ally, along with a expectation that China is exhorted to defuse the actions by NK.
