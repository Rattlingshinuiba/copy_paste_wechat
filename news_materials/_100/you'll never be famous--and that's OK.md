> Today’s collegestudents desperately want to change the world, but too many think that living ameaningful life requires doing something extraordinary and attention-grabbinglike becoming an Instagram celebrity, starting a **wildly** successful company or ending a humanitarian crisis.

如今的大学生竭力想改变世界，然而其中有太多人觉得要想活得有意义就得做点非比寻常，惹人注目之举，比如说成为网红，创办一家大获成功的公司，或者结束一场人道危机。

> Havingidealistic aspirations is, of course, part of being young. But thanks to socialmedia, purpose and meaning have become conflated with glamour: Extraordinarylives look like the norm on the internet. Yet the idea that a meaningful lifemust be or appear remarkable is not only elitist but also misguided. Over thepast five years, I’ve interviewed dozens of people across the country aboutwhat gives their lives meaning, and I’ve read through thousands of pages ofpsychology, philosophy and neuroscience research to understand what trulybrings people satisfaction.

在理想上有抱负是组成年轻的一部分。由于社交媒体的存在，目标和意义同魅力混为一谈：凡人不能所及的生活在网上看起来很平常。但是这样一种想法——有意义的生活必须或者看起来非比寻常——既体现着精英主义又会被误导。过去五年里，笔者采访全国上下几十多人，从中交流了是什么让他们生活变得有意义的内容。笔者还读了上千页与心理学，哲学以及神经科学相关的内容以了解是什么能真正给人带来满足。

> The mostmeaningful lives, I’ve learned, are often not the extraordinary ones. They’rethe ordinary ones lived with dignity.

笔者从中得知，最有意义的生活往往不是非比寻常的生活，而是**带有尊严的普通生活**。
