## Does China Play Fair？

At the heart of these tensions is one simple, overwhelming fact: firms around the world face ever more intense competition from their Chinese rivals. China is not the first country to industrialise, but none has ever made the leap so rapidly and on such a monumental scale. Little more than a decade ago Chinese boom towns churned out zips, socks and cigarette lighters. Today the country is at the global frontier of new technology in everything from mobile payments to driverless cars.

这些紧张局势的核心是一个简单又让人无以辩驳的事实：全世界的公司都面对着来自中国对手更为激烈的竞争。中国并非第一个实现工业化的国家，但是也从来没有哪个国家能在获得巨大发展中速度如此迅猛，规模如此具有里程碑意义。十多年前，中国新型城镇大量制造拉链，袜子和打火机。如今，中国在各个领域从手机支付到无人驾驶汽车都处于新兴科技在国际上的前沿地位。

Even as China’s achievements inspire awe, there is growing concern that the world will be dominated by an economy that does not play fair. Businesses feel threatened. Governments that have seen Brexit and the election of Mr Trump, worry about the effects of job losses and shrinking technological leadership. Yet if the outcome is to be good, they must all think clearly about the real nature of China’s challenge.

中国成就令人生畏的同时，也存在着日益增长的担忧：整个世界会由一个不按公平竞争的经济体来主宰。商业一方也感到威胁。各国政府见证了英国脱欧和川普登基，担忧起失业和技术领导地位日益削弱的结果。不过就算结果不算坏，政府也必须对中国挑战的本质进行清楚的思考。
