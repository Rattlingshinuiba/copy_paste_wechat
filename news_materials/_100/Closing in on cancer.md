## Closing in on cancer

THE numbers are stark. Cancer claimed the lives of 8.8m people in 2015; only heart disease caused more deaths. Around 40% of Americans will be told they have cancer during their lifetimes. It is now a bigger killer of Africans than malaria. But the statistics do not begin to capture the fear inspired by cancer’s silent and implacable cellular mutiny. Only Alzheimer’s exerts a similar grip on the imagination.

数字显得很严峻：2015年癌症剥夺了880万人的生命，其仅次于心脏病。约40%美国人在一生中会得知患上了癌症。癌症现在成为了比疟疾还要严重的非洲人杀手。癌症悄无声息，与人类势不两立地进行细胞突变，引起人们的恐惧，但是统计数据根本不能描述这类恐惧。只有老年痴呆症才能让人们有所想象。

Confronted with this sort of enemy, people understandably focus on the potential for scientific breakthroughs that will deliver a cure. Their hope is not misplaced. Cancer has become more and more survivable over recent decades owing to a host of advances, from genetic sequencing to targeted therapies. The five-year survival rate for **leukemia** in America has almost doubled, from 34% in the mid-1970s to 63% in 2006-12. America is home to about 15.5m cancer survivors, a number that will grow to 20m in the next ten years. Developing countries have made big gains, too: in parts of Central and South America, survival rates for prostate and breast cancer have jumped by as much as a fifth in only a decade.

人类面对此等敌人，将注意力放在科学突破的潜在可能性上，期望这些突破能带来治愈的情况，这种想法是可以理解的。人类没有期望错什么。得益于基因测序到靶向治疗的巨大发展，近几十年来，人们能够在癌症中存活下来的可能性越来越大。在美国，白血病患者五年存活率在19世纪中期是34%，到2006年底达到63%，比率几乎翻一番。美国拥有155万癌症存活患者，并且数目在接下来十年将会增长到200万。发展中国家也取得巨大进展：在中美洲和南美洲的部分地区前列腺癌和乳腺癌的存活率仅仅10年内就增长五分之一。

From a purely technical perspective, it is reasonable to expect that science will one day turn most cancers into either chronic diseases or curable ones. But cancer is not fought only in the lab. It is also fought in doctors’ surgeries, in schools, in public-health systems and in government departments. The dispatches from these battlefields are much less encouraging.

单从技术角度来看，去预期科学早晚有一天会将大多数癌症转变为慢性或可治愈疾病，这样的预期是合理的。然而对抗癌症的地点不只是在实验室，还有在医生的外科手术，学校，公共卫生系统以及政府部门之中。从这些“战场”中传来的消息看起来很少令人鼓舞。

First, the good news. Caught early, many cancers are now highly treatable. Three out of four British men who received a prostate-cancer diagnosis in the early 1970s did not live for another ten years; today four out of five do. Other cancers, such as those of the lung,**pancreas** and brain, are harder to find and treat. But as our Technology Quarterly shows, progress is being made. Techniques to enable early diagnosis include a device designed to detect cancer on the breath; blood tests can track fragments of DNA shed from tumours. Genome sequencing makes it ever easier to identify new drug targets.

首先是好消息，现在许多癌症若被早期发现就会得以高效治疗。20世纪70年代早期，英国人若收到前列腺癌的诊断书，其中就有四分之三的人数熬不过下一个十年，如今五分之四的人数可以再活下10年了。而其它诸如肺癌，胰腺癌和脑癌的癌症更难被发现及治疗。但正如本期刊的Technology Quarterly一栏所说，进展还是有的。有一些技术可以让早期诊断得以实现，这其中包括一个装置，该装置被设计而用来在呼吸上侦测出癌症；血液检验能够追踪到从肿瘤脱落下的DNA碎片。基因组测序使确认新药目标变得比以往都要更简单。

The established trio of 20th-century cancer treatments—surgery, radiation and chemotherapy—are all still improving. Radiotherapists can create **webs of** gamma rays, whose intersections deliver doses high enough to kill tumours but which do less damage to healthy tissue as they enter and leave the body. Some new drugs throttle the growth of blood vessels bringing nutrients to tumours; others attack cancer cells’ own DNA-repair kits. Cancer may be relentless; so too is science.

10世纪癌症治疗的著名三剑客——外科手术，放射治疗以及化疗——都在经历着改善。放射治疗人员可以将多个伽马射线得以产生，其进出机体，交叉部分产生的剂量高到足以破坏肿瘤，但又不会健康组织造成太大伤害。一些新药能遏制住给肿瘤运输养分的血管的生长，其他一些新药攻击癌细胞的DNA修复工具。癌症可能是无法阻挡的，但科学也是坚持不懈的。
