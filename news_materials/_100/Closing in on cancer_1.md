## Closing in on cancer

Variations between countries are partly a reflection of health-care spending: more than half of patients requiring radiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries do not have access to treatment. But big budgets do not guarantee good outcomes. Iceland and Portugal do not outspend England and Denmark on health care as a proportion of GDP, but past studies show wide variation in survivability in all cancers.

国家间的差异部分地体现出在医保上的花费：在低收入和中等收入国家中，多于一半的患者需要辐射治疗，却没有治疗渠道。然而高额预算并不能保证可观的结果。冰岛和葡萄牙在医保上的花费不比英格兰多，丹麦将医保作为其GDP的一部分，但是以前的研究表明，所有癌症在存活率方面上差异很大。

Instead, the problem is often how money is spent, not how much of it there is. To take one example, a vaccine exists against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cancers of the cervix in women, as well as cancers of the head and neck. Rwanda started a programme of routine vaccination in 2011, and aims to eradicate cervical cancer by 2020. Other countries are far less systematic. Vaccinations could help prevent cervical cancer in 120,000 Indian women each year.

与刚才说的不同，问题通常是钱如何花费，而不是钱有多少。举个例子，一种疫苗用来对抗乳头状瘤病毒，该病毒导致女性宫颈癌，也会导致脑癌和颈癌。2011年，卢旺达开启使疫苗接种常规化的一个项目，旨在到2020年根除宫颈癌。其他国家远远没达到系统化。疫苗接种每年能帮助12万印度女性防止宫颈癌的发生。

Policymakers are not powerless. More can be done to verify which treatments (and combinations thereof) work best. A £1.3bn ($2bn) cancer-drug fund in England, which made expensive new medicines easier to obtain, did not assess the efficacy of the drugs it provided—a huge missed opportunity. Measuring the incidence and survival of cancer, through cancer registries, spotlights where patients are being failed. Access to health care matters, too: the number of Americans whose cancers were diagnosed at the earliest possible opportunity went up after Obamacare was enacted. And prevention remains the best cure of all. Efforts to rein in tobacco use averted 22m deaths (many of them to cancer) between 2008 and 2014. Yet only a tenth of the world’s population lives in countries where taxes make up at least three-quarters of the price of cigarettes, as recommended by the World Health Organisation.

政策制定者是无能的。有更多的事情需要去做以确定哪种疗法效果最好。在英国，一份13亿的抗癌药基金能使贵重新药更易获得，但是其没有评估所提供的新药疗效——这真是严重地错失良机。通过癌症登记，对癌症的出现和患者的存活进行测量才能搞清楚病人在哪一步出错了。医保的渠道也很重要：奥巴马医保得以通过之后，美国人中癌症早期被诊断出的人数呈上升状态。对癌症的预防才是所有治疗中最有效的。2008年到2014年，对烟草控制的努力使2200万人的死亡得以避免。然而世界上税收占有烟草价格四分之三的国家其人口仅占十分之一。

Taxes and budgeting are a lot less exciting than tumour-zapping proton beams and antibodies with superpowers. But the decisions of technocrats are as important as the work of technicians. Cancer kills millions of people not simply for want of scientific advance, but also because of bad policy.

相比较消灭肿瘤的质子光速和强力的抗体，税收和预算远远没让人那么兴奋。但是技术型官方的决定与技术人员的工作同样重要。癌症夺取百万计人的生命，这不仅仅是因为缺乏科学进步，还因为存在有糟糕的政策。
