朝鲜领导人金正恩就特朗普在联合国大会上誓言若朝鲜威胁美国及其盟友，将“彻底摧毁朝鲜”的言论做出回应。

King Jun Un, North Korea’s leader, has responded to the vow uttered by Mr. Trump that the U.S. will “totally destroy NK” if NK threats it or its allies.

以下是声明全文：

The following is the entire announcement:

在近期朝鲜半岛局势空前激化，一触即发的危机状态每况愈下的严重情况下，美国当政者首次在联合国舞台上发表的演讲内容不能不说是世界焦点。

Recently，while the Korean Peninsula’s situation, on the brink of crisis, is heated up unprecedentedly, with serious growing threats, the speech delivered by the American leader, who debuts on the stage of the UNGS, is invariably drawing everyone around the world.

我曾多少予以预测，但因为这是一场全球最大的正式场合，所以我预料到他身为美国总统会发表与往常一样在自己办公室品凭一时冲动信口雌黄有所不同的已准备好的言论。

I have more or less given expectation. As this is one of world’s largest formal occasion, However, I manage to expect that Mr.Trump, an American president, is likely to utter his impulsive and wordy rhetoric which is somewhat different from that from his office.
