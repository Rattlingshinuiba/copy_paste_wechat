The US is the chief financier of the UN, funding more than 28 per cent of the $6.8bn peacekeeping budget — close to three times as much as the next largest financial backer, China. The US also funds 22 per cent of the smaller core UN budget.

美国是联合国的主要财主，投入了68亿美元预算来维护和平，占总预算逾28%，是中国的将近三倍之多。中国投入基金仅次于美国。相对较少的联合国核心预算也有22%来自美国。

 “Trump actually working with a multilateral body — it’s quite amazing,” said a UN official. “This is the exact opposite of what he has said before.”

一名联合国官员表示：“川普真的在与一个多边机构共事耶，这真是太给力了！他之前嘴上说不要，身体还是挺老实的呀。“

The US has come to rely on the UN Security Council this year as never before to squeeze North Korea’s economy through a series of unanimous sanctions resolutions.

美国今年比以往都要依靠安理会，通过一系列一致同意下的制裁措施以遏制朝鲜经济。

These have cut off 90 per cent of the regime’s export market and reduced petroleum products in a bid to bring its nuclear programme to a halt.

这些措施削减了朝鲜出口市场的90%，减少了石油进口以迫使朝鲜核计划停止。
