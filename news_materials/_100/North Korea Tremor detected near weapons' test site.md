A magnitude-3.4 earthquake has been detected in North Korea.

朝鲜境内据探测发生了一场3.4级地震。

The earthquake occurred about 50km from a nuclear test site,monitors say. Previous quakes have occurred during weapons' tests.

监测人员称，该地震产生于一个核试验地点，离该地点约有50000米。而以前的地震发生在朝鲜武器测试期间。

Chinese seismologists said it was a "suspected explosion". But South Korea says that it could be a natural quake not caused by a nuclear test.

中国地震学家称该地震是一场“令人起疑的爆炸”。然而韩国方面称改地震可能是一场自然发生的地震，而不是由核试验而引起。

North Korea carried out a massive nuclear test on 3 September which has been widely condemned at the UN.

9月3日，朝鲜进行了一次规模巨大的核测试，联合国多个成员对此表示谴责。

The size of Saturday's tremor is smaller than that usually detected when North Korea has tested weapons.

朝鲜进行武器测试时，地震规模可以被探测到，而今日的这场地震比往常探测到的规模要小。

After the last test, initial reports from the US Geological Survey put the tremor at magnitude 5.6 with a depth of 10km (six miles) but this was later upgraded to magnitude 6.3 at 0km.

最新的核试验过后，根据起初报道，美国地质调查局将地震定位5.6级，深度10000米，但是不久后该升级至震源0千米处的6.3及地震。

The latest quake was recorded at a depth of 0km in North Hamgyong province, home to the Punggye-ri nuclear site, South Korea's meteorological agency says.

韩国气象部门称，最新的这场地震经记录达到震源深度0km，发生在朝鲜咸镜道省，丰溪里核试验地点就位于该省。

It said it believed the quake was natural because the specific soundwaves generated by artificial earthquakes were not detected, Reuters news agency reports.

路透社报道，该部门还认为此场地震是自然发生，因为人工地震引发的特有声波未被检测到。

Analysts from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization are examining the "unusual seismic activity of a much smaller magnitude" in North Korea, executive secretary Lassina Zerbo tweeted.

来自全面禁止核试验条约组织的分析人士正在调查这场“远比以往等级小的一场地震活动”。

He said the quake occurred "about 50km from prior tests".

地震发生于离以往核测试距离约50000米处。
