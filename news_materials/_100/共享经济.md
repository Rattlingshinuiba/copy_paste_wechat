ONSEPTEMBER 3rd North Korea tested what it claimed was a hydrogenbomb. Whether it was really that, or merely a boosted fission device, is unclear.What is certain is that the bomb was **hefty**enough to cause big earth tremors in neighboring China. **Seismic** data suggest that the blast wasaround 120 kilotons—at least eight times more powerful than the North’sprevious test a year ago. If converted into a warhead small enough to fit on itsHwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile, it could kill nearly everyoneacross a 15-square-kilometer area. Even if Kim Jong Un’s ruthless regime doesnot have a hydrogen bomb today, it will withinke'neng year or so probably havemastered a technology that has the potential for almost unlimited destruction.

九月三日，朝鲜声称其测试了一枚氢弹。现在尚未清楚情况真是如此还是仅仅是个裂变推进装置。现在能确定的是这场爆炸威力巨大，造成了在邻国中国境内的强烈地震。地震数据显示此次爆炸将近有12万吨当量，威力是朝鲜去年核试验的起码八倍之多。这种威力下的氢弹如果改为小到足够装在火星14洲际导弹上的弹头，就会结束掉方圆15000平方米区域的几乎所有的·生命。就算属于金正恩的残暴政权现在没有氢弹，朝鲜也可能会在1年左右掌握一项几乎控制不了破坏力的技术。

## **The sharing craze**

China has embraced mobile phone basedpayment technology like nowhere else on the planet and it has led to thespectacular take-off of the so-called "sharing" economy.

似乎在这个星球上除了中国，其他地方不存在这样一种情况：手机支付技术，中国大力支持这种技术，并且引领了共享经济的飞黄腾达，真是令人叹为观止。

Some of it involves **genuine peer to peer** sharing schemes, like matching drivers withunused capacity in their cars to passengers going the same way.

共享经济中其中就有线下P2P共享计划，比如说司机车内有空座，就可以得到匹配，载客乘顺风车。

Others are more properly viewed as hi-techrental schemes, in which products like bikes, taxi rides or balls are matchedto customers, and millions of small payments are aggregated into large revenuestreams.

共享经济其它部分更多地为人们所视为高新技术租借计划，自行车，的士接送以及球类这些产品可与用户相匹配，接着数以百万计的小额支付积少成多，形成大量收益。

So hot is the sector in China right now,and so rapid is the growth, that it is drawing in billions of dollars ofventure capital funding.

在中国，这类行业十分火爆，也得了迅速发展，于是其吸引了数以十亿计美元的风投基金。
