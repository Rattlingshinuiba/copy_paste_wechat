## 人脸识别

THE human face is a remarkable piece of work. The astonishing variety of facial features helps people recognise each other and is crucial to the formation of complex societies. So is the face’s ability to send emotional signals, whether through an involuntary blush or the artifice of a false smile. People spend much of their waking lives, in the office and the courtroom as well as the bar and the bedroom, reading faces, for signs of attraction, hostility, trust and deceit. They also spend plenty of time trying to dissimulate.

人脸是个杰出之作。脸部特征各式各样让人叹为观止，让人们能互相认出对方，也在形成复杂社会上起到重要作用。脸在传达感情信号上也很关键，无论是通过自觉的脸红还是藏有诡计的假笑。在办公室，法庭，酒吧还有卧室，人们在清醒时刻花费大量时间解读脸部，以此获知吸引兴趣，敌意，信任和欺骗的迹象，也花费大量时间试以掩饰这些迹象。

Technology is rapidly catching up with the human ability to read faces. In America facial recognition is used by churches to track worshippers’ attendance; in Britain, by retailers to spot past shoplifters. This year Welsh police used it to arrest a suspect outside a football game. In China it verifies the identities of ride-hailing drivers, permits tourists to enter attractions and lets people pay for things with a smile. Apple’s new iPhone is expected to use it to unlock the homescreen.

技术快速发展，正在赶上人们解读脸部的能力。在美国，教堂用人脸识别来跟踪信徒的出勤率。在英国，裁缝用人脸识别来发现有前科的小偷。今年，威尔士警方使用人脸识别在足球场外逮捕了一名嫌犯。在中国，人脸识别可以确认的士/网约车司机的身份，准许旅客进入景点，让人们凭一个微笑就可购买物品。苹果研发的新款iphone有望利用人脸识别来解锁主屏幕。

Set against human skills, such applications might seem incremental. Some breakthroughs, such as flight or the internet, obviously transform human abilities; facial recognition seems merely to encode them. Although faces are peculiar to individuals, they are also public, so technology does not, at first sight, intrude on something that is private. And yet the ability to record, store and analyse images of faces cheaply, quickly and on a vast scale promises one day to bring about fundamental changes to notions of privacy, fairness and trust.

与人类技能相比，这样的一些应用可能显得发展缓慢。像飞机和互联网这样的一些重大突破明显改变了人类的能力。人脸识别似乎仅仅只对面孔加密。人脸是个人所仅有的，但是人脸又是公开的，所以从第一眼看/乍看起来，技术并没有侵犯私人之物。但是，既便宜又快速得大规模记录，存储，分析面部图片的能力可能有一天会对隐私，公正和信任的观点带来根本上的改变。
