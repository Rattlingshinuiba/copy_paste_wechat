President Donald Trump has scrapped an Obama-era policy thatallows immigrants who came to the US illegally as children to remain and workin the country, ignoring business leaders’ pleas not to kill the programme.

 

奥巴马执政时期有一政策，允许非法来到美国的儿童移民留在美国并在国内工作，而川普撕毁了此项政策。商业界领导人求川普不要毁了这项计划，但遭到了川普的无视。

Although Mr Trump called the “Dreamers” programme “amnesty” duringthe campaign, he had appeared to **soften**his position once in office, vowing to show “heart” to the 800,000 undocumentedimmigrants covered.

尽管川普在大选时曾将“追梦者”称为“受赦免者”，但他一当选后似乎立场变得又不那么强硬，并发誓会与80万名未登记的受调查移民表现出信任的态度。

By deciding to phase it out over six months, which the WhiteHouse said would enable Congress to legislate a replacement programme, Mr Trumprisked yet another battle with **Americanboardrooms**, which have become increasingly frustrated with theadministration for recent protectionist trade policies and a perceived failureto stand up to white nationalists.

 

川普决定在六月内移除此政策，白宫方面称这会使国会立法通过一项替代计划。川普有风险与**美国企业董事会**陷入一场争斗。对于最近的贸易保护政策还有反对白人民族主义者的明显失败，美国企业董事会越来越感到沮丧
