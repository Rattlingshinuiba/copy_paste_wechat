中国致力于建设和平稳定的新亚太。中国身处亚太，亚太地区的稳定与中国国家利益息息相关。为了维护亚太地区的和平稳定，我们提出构建中美新型大国关系，探索不同类型大国间不冲突，不对抗，相互尊重，合作共赢的交往模式。中国倡导共同，综合，合作，可持续的亚洲安全观，期望构建符合本地区需要，为各国普遍接受，同时具有开放，稳定特征的安全合作架构。

China is committed to the establishment of the new Asia-Pacific region in the state of peace and stability. Located in Asia-Pacific region, China has indispensable relationship with the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. To uphold it, we propose a model that construct new Sino-American relationship for communication and seek non-conflict, non-rebellion, mutual respect and win-win among major nations of different kind. China embraces Asian security principle that involves joint effort, comprehensive practice, cooperation and sustainability, and looks to construct an open and stable frame of security and cooperation that meets the need of this region, thus being acceptable across the world.
