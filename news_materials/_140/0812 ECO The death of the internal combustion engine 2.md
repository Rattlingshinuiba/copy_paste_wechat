> The shift from fuel and pistons to batteries and electric motors is unlikely to take that long. The first death rattles of the internal combustion engine are already reverberating around the world—and many of the consequences will be welcome.

从燃料和活塞转变到电池与电动马达的时间似乎会很快实现。从内燃机内部发出的消亡之声已响彻全世界，而对于其产生的许多后果，人们表示并不会抗拒。

> To gauge what lies ahead, think how the internal combustion engine has shaped modern life. The rich world was rebuilt for motor vehicles, with huge investments in road networks and the invention of suburbia, along with shopping malls and drive-through restaurants. Roughly 85% of American workers commute by car. Carmaking was also a generator of economic development and the expansion of the middle class, in post-war America and elsewhere. There are now about 1bn cars on the road, almost all powered by fossil fuels. Though most of them sit idle, America’s car and lorry engines can produce ten times as much energy as its power stations. The internal combustion engine is the mightiest motor in history.

若想探测出我们前方迎来的是什么，那么就想想内燃机是如何塑造现代生活的吧。马达驱动车辆重建了整个发达国家，这些国家投入大量资金于公路网络，创造了郊区生活，同时建造了购物商场和免下车餐厅。约85%的美国工作者乘车往返上下班。在二战后的美国及其它地区，汽车制造也为经济发展提供了动力，还是中产阶级扩大的标志。现在越有10亿辆汽车上路，几乎全由矿物燃料驱动。尽管大多数车都处于闲置状态，但美国的小汽车和卡车引擎可以产生十倍于美国发电站的能量。内燃机是史上最强驱动装置。

> But electrification has thrown the car industry into turmoil. Its best brands are founded on their engineering heritage—especially in Germany. Compared with existing vehicles, electric cars are much simpler and have fewer parts; they are more like computers on wheels. That means they need fewer people to assemble them and fewer subsidiary systems from specialist suppliers. Carworkers at factories that do not make electric cars are worried that they could be for the chop. With less to go wrong, the market for maintenance and spare parts will shrink. While today’s carmakers grapple with their costly legacy of old factories and swollen workforces, new entrants will be unencumbered. Premium brands may be able to stand out through styling and handling, but low-margin, mass-market carmakers will have to compete chiefly on cost.

然而电力化使汽车行业陷入混乱。汽车行业中其最优质品牌建立在工程上的遗传因素之上——特别是在德国。与现存的车辆相比，电动汽车简单得多并且其组成部件更少；电动汽车更像是长着轮子的电脑。那就意味着组装电动汽车不需多人就可完成，也不需多少来自专家级供应商的辅助系统便可运转。在不制造电动汽车的工厂中，汽车制造者担心他们可能要遭受裁员。由于汽车出毛病的次数更少，市场上对于保修和备用部件的需求就会缩减。现在的汽车制造者正努力应对传统工厂耗资巨大的遗留问题，还得应对增加的劳动力，那么新加入者就无一席之地。奢侈品牌会因样式和操纵手感尚能屹立不倒，然而低利润，面向大众市场的汽车制造者就不得不主要在成本上竞争。
