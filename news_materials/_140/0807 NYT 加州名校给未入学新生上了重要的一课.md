> I became interested in the story partly because I’ve lavished   praise on Irvine in the past. It has ranked No. 1 for the past two years in The Times’s College Access Index, which evaluates about 170 top colleges based on economic diversity and the cost of attendance. Irvine is an impressive place, and I wanted to figure out how its leaders could have bungled the situation so badly.

我对这个故事饶有兴致，部分原因是我曾经在过去对欧文校区大加赞赏。欧文校区过去两年里在时代周刊的大学入学指数上排名第二，该指数基于经济多样化与出勤花费，估分排名了170多所顶尖大学。欧文校是令人印象深刻之地，而我想弄清其领导是如何将事态恶化的。

> So I spent some time talking with them this week. I came away thinking it was a classic case of well-meaning people making a series of small mistakes that added up to a big mistake — and then persuading themselves that they hadn’t messed up. I had already written a draft of a column harshly critical of the university and was planning to publish it this morning. (If you want a flavor of that criticism, read this tough Los Angeles Times editorial from Wednesday morning.)

所以我本周抽空和这些领导谈了谈。我一开始认为这是个好心人犯一系列小错误最终产生大错的经典案例——然后这些人自我说服，觉得他们才没搞砸。我写好了一份期刊稿子，猛烈批判了这所大学，并准备在早上发稿。（如果你觉得那种批判对你口味，那么在周三早上读这份苛刻的洛杉矶时报文章吧。）

> Then something remarkable happened.

然后发生了惊人之事。

> After days of defending their actions, Irvine’s leaders admitted on Wednesday that they had made a mistake. They have reinstated most of the rescinded acceptances. Howard Gillman, Irvine’s chancellor, publicly apologized.

在欧文校区领导辩护他们的行为过去几天后，他们在周三承认犯了一个错误，而且恢复了大多数撤销过的通知书。欧文校区校长霍华德公开道歉。

> I still have some questions and concerns about the new policy, and I hope Irvine’s critics keep monitoring the situation. But the change is a big improvement. And it’s an all-too-rare instance of people in power being willing to change their minds — to decide that the embarrassment of changing course is better than doubling down on a mistake.

对于这个新政策，我仍怀有问题和疑虑，希望欧文的评论家继续监督事态。但是能做出改变就是个巨大改善了。掌握权力的人愿意改变他们的想法，这实属罕见——决定改变原先的线路是很尴尬，但这总比将错误加倍好得多。

> The Irvine story starts with a problem that’s entirely understandable: There is no foolproof way to predict how many students will say yes to a college’s admission offer. The percentage of students who respond positively is known as “yield,” and it fluctuates year to year, based on the economy, the admissions practices of other colleges and the whims of teenagers.

欧文校区事件开端所带来的问题完全为人们所理解：没有简单的方法能预估多少学生接受录取通知书。积极回应的学生所占百分比是“收成”，并且年年有浮动，这取决于经济，其他大学的录取做法和年轻人的心血来潮。
