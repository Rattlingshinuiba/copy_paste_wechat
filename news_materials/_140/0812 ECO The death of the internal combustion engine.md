> “HUMAN inventiveness…has still not found a mechanical process to replace horses as the propulsion for vehicles,” lamented Le Petit Journal, a French newspaper, in December 1893. Its answer was to organise the Paris-Rouen race for horseless carriages, held the following July. The 102 entrants included vehicles powered by steam, petrol, electricity, compressed air and hydraulics. Only 21 qualified for the 126km (78-mile) race, which attracted huge crowds. The clear winner was the internal combustion engine. Over the next century it would go on to power industry and change the world.

在1893年11月，一法国报纸Le Petit Journal悲哀道：“人类发明创造，但尚未有一机械化流程能替代马匹来驱动交通工具。”作为对这一说法的回答，无马车辆巴黎-鲁昂竞赛得以筹办，并于来年7月举行。102辆新成员车辆其驱动力包括蒸汽，汽油，电力，压缩空气以及液压。只有21辆有资格进行126千米竞赛，这吸引了大批人群观看。内燃机毫无悬念地赢得了这场比赛。在接下来一个世纪里，内燃机将会为工业提供动力，并且改变整个世界。

> But its days are numbered. Rapid gains in battery technology favour electric motors instead. In Paris in 1894 not a single electric car made it to the starting line, partly because they needed battery-replacement stations every 30km or so. Today’s electric cars, powered by lithium-ion batteries, can do much better. The Chevy Bolt has a range of 383km; Tesla fans recently drove a Model S more than 1,000km on a single charge. UBS, a bank, reckons the “total cost of ownership” of an electric car will reach parity with a petrol one next year—albeit at a loss to its manufacturer. It optimistically predicts electric vehicles will make up 14% of global car sales by 2025, up from 1% today. Others have more modest forecasts, but are hurriedly revising them upwards as batteries get cheaper and better—the cost per kilowatt-hour has fallen from $1,000 in 2010 to $130-200 today. Regulations are tightening, too. Last month Britain joined a lengthening list of electric-only countries, saying that all new cars must be zero-emission by 2050.

但是目前来看，内燃机能存活下来的时间所剩无几。电池技术的快速发展有利于电动马达的发展，而不是内燃机。1894年巴黎的那场比赛中，没有一辆电动车能开到起跑线，其部分原因是它们需要大约每30千米有电池更换站。今日由锂离子电池驱动的电动车会发挥地更好。雪佛兰Bolt可开达383千米；特斯拉死忠今日开了Model S，其能在单次充电开到1000千米还要多。一家叫UBS的银行预测一辆电动汽车的“所有者总消费”将会在下一年与汽油相持平——尽管这种预测对制造商来说是一头雾水。此家银行还乐观预测到2025年电动车辆将占全球车辆销售份额的14%之多。其他预测人士更为中肯，但当电池更便宜和其质量更好时，这些人就赶紧把之前的话给改写了——时至今日，每千瓦小时花费从2010年的1000美元下降到现在的130到200美元。对电动汽车的监管力度也在加大。英国于上月加入其参与者不断增多的电力国家，其称所有的新汽车到2050年必须实现0排放。
