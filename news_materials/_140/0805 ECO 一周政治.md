> Preceding the White House drama, the push in the Senate to pass a “skinny” bill on health-care reform failed, when three Republicans, including John McCain, joined Democrats in voting against the measure.

白宫风波发生前，有关医保改革的一项“没有份量”的法案在参议院没有得到通过。包括约翰麦凯恩在内的三名共和党人占到民主党一边，投票反对这份法案。

> Mr Trump signed a bill that imposes sanctions on Russia over its meddling in last year’s election, but which also limits the president’s power to tamper with Congress’s decision. He described the legislation as “seriously flawed”. Russia retaliated by vowing to expel 755 American diplomats.

川普签署了一份议案，其内容与去年俄罗斯干预大选有关，并对俄罗斯施加经济制裁，这份议案同时也限制了总统干预国会决定的权力。川普形容这份法案有“严重缺陷”。俄罗斯方面进行了反击，发誓要将755名美国外交官驱逐回国。

> The International Olympic Committee announced that it had agreed to a deal that will award the summer Olympics in 2028 to Los Angeles. The deal means that the Olympics in 2024 will be held in Paris, which Los Angeles was competing against to host that year. The 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles are seen as the most successful ever, even though the Soviet Union and many east European countries boycotted them.

国际奥委会宣布其同意一项协议，协议内容是授予洛杉矶举办2028年夏季奥运会的权力。这份协议意味着2014年奥运会将由巴黎举办，去年洛杉矶还在与巴黎竞争举办场地。人们认为1984年由洛杉矶举办的懊悔是最为成功的一次，尽管当时苏联和许多东欧国家抵制这场奥运会。
