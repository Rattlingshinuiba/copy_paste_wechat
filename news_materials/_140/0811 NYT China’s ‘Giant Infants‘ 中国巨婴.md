> BEIJING — My generation of urban Chinese, born in the 1980s and 1990s under the one-child policy, were long labeled “little emperors,” a term used to characterize us as narcissistic and weak-willed children spoiled by parental attention and newfound material comfort. It was an image that we rejected: In reality, as I used to joke with friends, our lives of academic grind and adolescent boredom felt closer to that of an overworked county clerk than a privileged little brat. Gradually, as single-child families became the norm, the term fell out of use.

在中国城镇出生的我这一代，也就是在80年代和90年代计划生育下出生的这一代，长期以来为人所贴上“小皇帝”的标签，这种标签即一种称呼，用来给予我们如下特点：为父母所关心，拥有新建立起的物质安逸，被溺爱，并且自恋又意志力羸弱。我们不承认这种描述，事实上，我常常和朋友开玩笑，相比较坐拥特权的熊孩子，我们的经历从书呆子到青少年时的无所事事更类似于超负荷工作的县城公务员。慢慢地，随着独生子女家庭不再那么稀奇，这种称呼才不在为人们所使用。

> But as young people are venturing into the real world and confronting economic and social challenges with a complexity unknown to our parents, many of us are starting to wonder whether the “little emperor” label had been more accurate than we thought.

但是当年轻人曾经从仗剑走天涯的幻想中走出来，冒险进入现实世界，迎面经济和社会挑战——这些挑战对我们父母来说都是复杂且未知的——于是我们当中许多人开始想“小皇帝”这个称呼是不是比我们自己认为的更为准确无误。

> Many of my peers, finding themselves overwhelmed by the trials of adulthood, have begun to reflect critically on how middle-class kids are raised in urban China. Perhaps what were considered markers of my generation’s privilege — intensive parenting, rigorous education and consumerist culture — are in fact our bane, making us self-centered and emotionally isolated, struggling to find independence and fulfillment in a fast-changing society.

在我的同龄人当中，有很多人发现自己被成人的考验所压垮，于是他们开始批判性地沉思这样一个问题：在中国城镇，中产阶级的孩子是如何被养育的。或许实际上，造成我们困扰的东西正是所谓我这一代的特权特征，即集中式养育，严厉的教育以及消费者文化，这些使我们更加地以自我为中心，情绪上与外界隔离，让我们于快速变化的社会中费力寻找独立和充实感。

> The evidence is hard to miss: the Chinese student overseas who calls home every day sobbing; the fashionable young woman who screams at a mortified boyfriend in public; the top-performing university student who stops going to class and loses himself in video games. In the latest dating show taking television by storm, contestants appear onstage flanked by their parents, who grill suitors before their children are allowed to meet them.

理想很丰满，现实很骨感：海外留学生每天往家里打电话都会哭泣，打扮时尚的年轻女子在公共场合对着尴尬的男友大吼大叫，在排名前几的大学里就读的学生不再去上课，转而沉迷于电子游戏。最新席卷电视的相亲节目中，在允许父母的孩子见面相亲竞争者前，这些竞争者得出现在台子上，由对方父母打量，并且作为求偶者，还要受到大量提问。

> Chinese people have “giant infant” syndrome, says Wu Zhihong, a psychiatrist and author of a best-selling book called “A Country of Giant Infants” who lists symptoms that call to mind a grown-up “little emperor.” In Mr. Wu’s view, social problems from littering in public places to codependency in romantic relationships have their roots in China’s family-centered culture and its new levels of oppression that stunt individual psychological growth.

心理治疗师兼畅销书《巨婴国》作者武志红称，中国人患了种病，叫“巨婴”综合征，他列出了一系列症状，让人们想起了“小皇帝”。在武志红看来，譬如公共场合乱丢垃圾，或在爱情上相互扶持，这些行为都有它们的根，其就在以家为中心的文化和新层次的压力，这两种因素对心理成长不理。
