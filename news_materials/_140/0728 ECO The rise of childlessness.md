> POCKET LIVING has been building and selling small flats in London since 2005. The flats have many of the things that young, single people want, such as bicycle storage, and lack the things they do not, such as large kitchens and lots of bookshelves. At first, Pocket expected that most buyers would be in their late 20s, says Marc Vlessing, the firm’s boss. Instead the average age is 32, and rising. It is not that many buyers are yet to have children, speculates Mr Vlessing; rather, they probably will never have them.

Pocket Living从05年开始就在伦敦建造和售卖小型公寓。这些公寓有许多单身年轻人想要的东西，比如自行车仓库；这些公寓也没有许多单身年轻人不想要的东西，比如大面积厨房和大量书架。Pocket老板Marc Vlessing称公司一开始预期会有很多购买者处于奔三的年纪，然而实际上平均年龄是32岁，并且其大小还在上升。Vlessing作出推测，认为这种现象并不是说许多购买者准备要孩子，相反，他们在未来可能不会去要孩子。

> A growing number of city-dwelling Europeans are in the same situation. Just 9% of English and Welsh women born in 1946 had no children. For the cohort born in 1970—who, barring a few late surprises, can be assumed to be done with babies—the proportion is 17%. In Germany 22% of women reach their early 40s without children; in Hamburg 32% do.

在欧洲的城镇住户中，越来越多的人也处于这种状况。仅仅9%出生于1946年英格兰和威尔士的女性没有孩子。至于同一批在1970年出生的女性，除了晚些时候的惊人之事（指婴儿潮），本来她们是预计不去生孩子的，结果是她们中没有孩子的人数所占比例为17%。在德国，刚四十出头的女性有22%没有孩子，其中汉堡有32%没有孩子。

> All of which might seem to suggest that Europe is bent on self-erasure. Childlessness is “a symptom of a feeble and terminally ill culture” that has lost touch with its heritage, according to Iben Thranholm, a conservative Danish journalist. The suggestion is misleading, however. Mass childlessness is not a sign of demographic collapse, nor is it remotely novel. It would be more accurate to say that rich countries are updating a long tradition.

这些现象似乎是在表明欧洲决意要走向自我灭忘。一名保守派丹麦记者Iben Thranholm称丁克是“一种绝症，表现出虚弱又无可救药的文化现象”，其与后代失去联结。不过这种说法是误导人的。大量丁克现象并不是人口毁灭的迹象，也不是特别新鲜的事。发达国家在更新一项长期以来的传统，这种说法才显得更加准确。

> The reasons why people do not have children are varied, complex and often overlapping. A few never wanted them. Others do not meet the right person. Some fall in love with people who already have children, and feel satisfied. Others suffer from medical problems. A great many fall into a group that Ann Berrington, a demographer at the University of Southampton, calls “perpetual postponers”. Waiting to start a family until they are finished with education, until they have a stable job and a house, they find it is too late.

人们不要孩子的原因多样，复杂，又存在重叠。一些部分从未想要过孩子，其他人还未遇到自己心仪的对象，一些和有家室的人堕入爱河，就这样也很满足，又有其他人因疾病问题而受苦。南安普顿大学的人口统计学家Ann Berrington提出一种类别，将大多数人称为“永久性剩男剩女”。等这些人想等到受教育结束后，有了固定工作和一套房子后再等着去组建家庭，发现为时已晚。
