> This pattern partly reflects the well-known problems that women have in advancing to senior positions, whether because of old boys’ networks or familial divisions of labour. But it is also reflective of how job markets work. For rank-and-file jobs, requirements and pay scales are largely standardised; both vacancies and candidates are plentiful. The hiring of chief executives, television stars or top footballers, however, is a different matter. These are in limited supply; paying up to outbid competitors is not unusual.

此模式部分反映了普遍为人所知的女性在升职中具备的难题，这种难题原因是丈夫的人脉或者是由工作导致的家庭分歧。不过这同时也反映出劳动市场是如何运转的。在普通工作上，工作需求量和工资数目是在很大程度上标准化的，空职数和候选人数都数目巨大。但是这与首席执行官，电视明星或顶尖足球运动员受到雇佣不同：后者职位供应有限制，想通过花费更多的钱来打败竞争者是通常行不通的。

> Lack of clear-cut rules and secrecy about pay for top jobs mean that candidates have lots of leeway to negotiate, says Benjamin Frost of Korn Ferry. Research shows that women do worse than men in negotiating salaries. Bias is partly to blame: surveys suggest that when women put their hands up for a promotion, they are more likely to be viewed as pushy, whereas men are viewed as ambitious. In 2014 hacked e-mails revealed that Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar-winning actress, was paid less than her male co-stars in “American Hustle”. She later said that she had not bargained harder because of expectations to act nicely.

在孔发利工作的本杰明弗罗斯特称，缺少条条框框，也缺少针对高级职位的工资保密性，这意味着候选者有余地去协商工资。研究表明，在协商薪水问题上女性表现地比男性差，其部分原因是偏见：调查显示女性着手准备晋升时更可能被视为表现地纠缠不休，然而男性让人觉得是雄心壮志。2014年，被黑掉的邮件中揭示了奥斯卡奖获得者女演员珍妮弗劳伦斯在《美国骗局》赚的比和她合作出演的男性演员少。

> A new law in Britain requires all biggish employers to publish, by April 2018, data on the pay gap between their male and female employees. The reactions to the BBC’s list suggest they would be wise to break these data down for comparable jobs. That will show more precisely where the problem lies.

英国一项新法规要求大公司要在2018年4月前公布它们男性与女性雇员的工资差异。从大众对BBC这个名单的反应来看，各大公司若能将那些支付水平类似的数据的工作不予以显示，是表现地很明智的，这将会更大程度精准地显示出问题的症结所在。
