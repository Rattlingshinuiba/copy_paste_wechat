> North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Friday that, for the first time, appeared capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States, according to experts — a milestone that American presidents have long declared the United States could not tolerate.

周五，朝鲜测试了一枚洲际导弹。专家认为，似乎这枚洲际导弹首次具备到达美国西海岸的能力，特朗普长期称美国不能容忍这种事件，如今这次测试使事态进一步升级。

> The launch, the second of an intercontinental missile in 24 days, did not answer the question of whether the North has mastered all the technologies necessary to deliver a nuclear weapon to targets in the lower 48 states. But just a few days ago, the Defense Intelligence Agency warned the Trump administration that the North would probably be able to do so within a year, and Friday’s test left little doubt that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is speeding toward that goal.

距离上次发射洲际导弹已有24天，这场第二次发射尚未回答这样一问题：朝鲜是否具有必需技术来装载核武器，使其能命中48个州。不过在几天前，国防情报局警告特朗普政府朝鲜可能一年内具有核打击能力，周五的测试使人们几乎不需质疑朝鲜领导人金正恩正加紧达到此目标。

> The missile launched on Friday remained aloft for roughly 47 minutes, according to American, South Korean and Japanese officials, following a steep trajectory that took it roughly 2,300 miles into space. It then turned and arced sharply down into the sea near the northernmost Japanese island, Hokkaido.

据美国，韩国和日本官员称，这枚周五发射的导弹通过倾斜的抛物线跨约2300英里，进入太空，接着在悬在空中持续大约47分钟，之后转而以弧状急剧下降落入日本最北部岛屿北海道附近海域中。
