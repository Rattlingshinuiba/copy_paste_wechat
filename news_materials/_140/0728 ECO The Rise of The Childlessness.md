> Men are erratic. Some are reproductive prodigies, having many children with more than one partner. Others—more than is the case for women—have none at all. Ms Berrington finds that 22% of British men born in 1958 were childless at the age of 46, compared with 16% of women. And in many countries childless men are disproportionately working class. French men who have never worked are about twice as likely to have no children as men who hold good white-collar jobs. Michaela Kreyenfeld, a demographer at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, finds that 36% of west German men without university degrees born in the early 1970s were childless in their early 40s. Among men with degrees, the rate was 28%.

男人很奇怪。一些男性人称生育小能手，和不止一个伴侣有染，当了很多孩子的爹。其他男性则根本没孩子，这种情况比女性多得多了。伯灵顿女士发现在英国22%生于1958年的男性到了46岁还没孩子，相比较下，女性占16%，并且在很多国家没孩子的男性其身份大多是蓝领。法国男性中从未就业的男人比拥有体面的白领工作的男人更可能没孩子，这种可能性大概是二倍比例。柏林赫蒂管理学院的Michaela Kreyenfeld发现在西德36%生于上世纪70年代没大学学历的男人在他们40出头时还没孩子，相比较有学历的人，其没孩子的人数占比28%。

> That suggests men and women end up childless for quite different reasons. Women often have no children because they have prioritised education or work in their 20s and 30s. Men are more likely to remain childless because women do not view them as good boyfriend material—let alone good husband or father material. “They have a problem finding partners,” suggests Ms Kreyenfeld.

以上表明男性和女性若沦落到没孩子的地步，其原因大有不同。通常情况下女性没有孩子是因为她们需要在20，30岁优先选择受教育和工作。男性没孩子的可能性很大，因为女性认为他们不是个好情种，更别提当好丈夫或是当爹的好苗子。Ms Kreyenfeld称“他们找对象有困难。”

> The distinction might be disappearing, however. In western Germany, childlessness is rising among less educated women, who are converging with their highly educated peers. In Finland, a switch has already occurred: women with only a basic education are the most likely to remain childless. It may be that, as two-earner households become more common, men have taken to judging women as women have long judged men. Those who fail to land dependable jobs might not be given a good opportunity to have children.

不过，以上说的这种差别可能让人失望了。在西德，教育程度更低的女性当中无孩现象在增多，她们和相对比受教育程度高的同辈趋于相似。在芬兰，已经发生一种变化：仅受基本教育的女性最可能没孩子。原因可能是，当家庭中丈夫和妻子赚得的钱变得越来越等同，男性就开始判断女性，跟女性长期判断男性一样。没能谋得铁饭碗的人可能没有机会要孩子了。

> Nobody knows whether childlessness will rise further. It has been going up in most European countries, but not all: the rate has fallen in Switzerland, for example. One possibility is that childlessness will veer up and down, mirroring the economic cycle. As the average age of marriage rises and couples push childbearing into their mid- or even late 30s, they become increasingly vulnerable to shocks. A bad recession or a mortgage-lending squeeze will encourage couples to pause—and, because many now give themselves only a narrow window before their fertility drops, some will be knocked out of childbearing altogether.

无人知晓无孩现象会不会继续上升，在多数欧洲国家，这种现象势力不减，但也有例外，举个例子，瑞士的无孩率已下降。一种可能性是无孩现象存在上下浮动，反映着经济循环。随着结婚平均年龄上升，夫妇们将育儿育女往后推到35岁甚至将近40岁，他们面对冲击变得越来越脆弱不堪。严重的经济不景气和借贷压力会促使夫妻缓一缓（不要孩子），还有由于很多人在他们生育能力下降之前太保贞守节，觉得性事肮脏，以至于一些人完全没可能有孩子了。

> That seems to be happening in America, points out Tomas Sobotka, of the Vienna Institute of Demography. The proportion of 45-year-old American women without children has fallen steadily since the turn of the century. Following the financial crisis of 2007, though, childlessness among 30- and 35-year-old women shot up.No matter what their intentions, many of these women are likely to remain childless.

维也纳人口学研究所的Tomas Sobotka指出，这种现象似乎正在美国上演。21世纪以来，美国45岁没孩子的女性占比稳步下降。不过，07年金融危机后，30到35岁女性中的无孩现象骤升。无论她们目的为何，许多女性可能会保持不要孩子的状态。

> That will not be such a terrible fate. Childlessness is often undesired, but in rich Western countries it is hardly calamitous. As the peculiarly procreative generation born around the middle of the 20th century passes away, it will come to seem ever more normal.

果真如此也不会是坏事。人们对无后之事嗤之以鼻，不过对于发达西方国家来讲这并不是灾难性的。当上世纪50年代的那些古怪又特能生的那一代与新时代的一代交接重任时，无孩现象会一直再也正常不过。 **（最后一段仅代表作者观点，原文写得更刺激人，我几乎全是意译的。）**
