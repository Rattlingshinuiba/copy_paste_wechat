> IT HAS been a turbulent few days for the BBC, Britain’s public broadcaster. On July 19th it published the names of those to whom it pays £150,000 ($195,000) or more a year. The ensuing furore was less over the level of pay, but the differences between men and women. Some female presenters discovered that they earned much less than their male peers. Of the 96 people listed, two-thirds are men; across the BBC, just over half are.

这几天对英国广播公司BBC来说不太安宁。7月19日，BBC公开了其年薪达到15万英镑甚至更多的员工姓名。工资的水平并没怎么引起公愤，引起公愤的是男性和女性的差异。一些女性播音主持发现他们相比同辈男性赚的更少。列入名单的96人中三分之二是男性，假如这比例反映了BBC各处的情况，也就比一半多一点。

> In a petition, female presenters said this was evidence that women at the BBC are paid less than men “for the same work”. Although this may be true for people on the BBC’s list, it is much less clear for the rest of its 9,000 female employees: a gender pay gap at the top of an organisation does not necessarily mean that similar gaps exist at lower levels.

女性播音主持在请愿中认为这赤裸裸地表现出女性在同等工作下赚的比男性更少。从BBC的这个名单来看，这种观点可能对人们来讲没有错，然而对BBC剩余的9000名女性雇员来讲可能就含糊其辞了：性别工资鸿沟在管理高层不一定意味着这种类似的鸿沟出现于低层员工上。

> In Britain, as in other European countries, the average gap in pay between men and women in exactly the same jobs is tiny or non-existent, according to data for 8.7m employees worldwide gathered by Korn Ferry, a consultancy. The difference is also narrow in each of the 16 job levels in the database—except, crucially, in the highest one, in which men in some countries are indeed paid a lot more than women .

孔发利咨询顾问公司从世界各地收集了870万雇员的数据，根据其数据，从事同一工作的男性和女性工资平均差异，无论在英国还是其他欧洲国家，都是很小或者不存在的，这种差异在数据库中的16种工作水平中也很小。除了以上所说的，关键是一些国家的男性在最高层的确赚得比女性多得多。
