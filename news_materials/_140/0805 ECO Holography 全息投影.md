## 0805 ECO Holography 全息投影

> HOLOGRAPHY is a useful technology, but somehow faintly disappointing. The fantasy is of a “Star Trek” style holodeck, or even the less ambitious idea of three-dimensional television pictures. The reality, for the man or woman in the street, issmudgy images that act as security features on credit cards, passports and an increasing number of banknotes.

全息投影是个挺有用的技术，不过有点不尽人意。人们所幻想的是星际旅行式的全息甲板，或者是相对比没那么有野心的想法：立体电视图像。对走在大街的男女来讲，这种技术在现实就是模糊不清的图像，在信用卡，护照和不断印发的钞票上当防伪标识。

smudgy，from smudge， in the sense of "suffocating smoke", related to "cure herring by smoking".

smudge: a dirty mark or stain, esp. such as is caused by a smear or by trying to rub out a previous

> Holography does have many uses beyond this. These include projecting 3D art displays in museums, enabling measurements to be made with great precision using a technique called holographic interferometry, and accurately assessing the three dimensions of packages for shipping companies. But the difference between the high-quality holograms required for those applications and the quotidian credit-card variety is that a laser and special equipment are needed to project them. Indeed, if the hologram is in colour, three lasers are needed, one for each primary: red, green and blue. The result is not always persuasive. Getting the primary holograms to overlap perfectly is hard. And to see the picture usually requires a darkened room.

远比这些，全息投影还有许多用处，包括在博物馆投放立体艺术展览，用叫做全息干涉测量的技术来实现非同小可的精准测量，以及为航运公司估量货物的立体图像。但是与日常信用卡不同的是，满足那些应用的高质量全息投影需要激光和特殊装置来保护。事实上，全息投影在颜色方面上，需要三种激光，一一对应三原色：红，绿，蓝。但结果没有什么说服力：想让原色形成的全息投影完美地相互重叠很困难。而且要观看这种图像通常需要一个暗室。

> All this led Rajesh Menon, an engineer at the University of Utah, to start eyeing up butterflies—notably the bright blue morphos found in Central and South America. The striking colour of a morpho’s wings (see picture) is the product not of pigment, but of the structure and arrangement of the scales on those wings. These scales refract light, splitting it into its component wavelengths, and also diffract it, causing those various wavelengths to interfere with one another. As a result, blue wavelengths are intensified and reflected back to the onlooker while those of other colours either cancel each other out or are scattered, and thus minimised. Moreover, unlike today’s holograms, the colour and appearance of a morpho’s wings remain the same, regardless of the angle they are viewed from.

这些促使犹他大学工程师Rajesh Menon开始把注意力放在蝴蝶身上——尤其是在中美洲和南美洲发现的亮蓝色闪蛱蝶。闪蛱蝶翅膀的鲜艳颜色不是由色素，而是由那些翅膀上鳞片的结构和排列形成的。这些鳞片能折射光，将其分成光组成的波长，并且造成衍射，使不同的波长互相干涉。最终，蓝波长增强，反射到观察者严重，其他颜色要么互相消除，要么分散开去，最终减弱。再者，与今日的全息投影不同，不论从哪种角度看她们，闪蛱蝶翅膀的颜色和外貌保持一致。
