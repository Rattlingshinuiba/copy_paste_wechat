> A 2013 study by Australian scholars showed that compared with older cohorts with siblings, members of China’s one-child generation are more prone to traits like risk aversion and pessimism. These are reflected, for instance, in their preference for stable jobs and their difficulty in adjusting to work environments. According to recent career surveys, college graduates have consistently ranked government jobs as their top choice, yet they frequently complain of the stress and boredom, as well as the difficulty of navigating interpersonal relations. One-quarter quit their first job within a year.

澳大利亚学者在2013年进行的一项研究显示，中国计划生育的一代与年龄更大的有兄弟姐妹的那一代相比较，计划生育的一代更倾向于表现这样的特征：如规避风险和悲观情绪。这些特征反应了一些现象，举个例子：他们会首选稳定的工作，而且在适应工作环境上充满困难。根据最近的职业调查，大学毕业生一致性地将政府工作排到首选位置，尽管他们经常抱怨做这种工作有压力和充满无聊，还有在人际关系处理方面上具有困难。这些人中有四分之一在一年内就辞去第一份工作。

> "People born in the ’80s and ’90s, having always had their life mapped out by parents, have trouble switching from their child identity into that of a working professional,” wrote Miao Lijuan, a business commentator, in an essay dissecting millennials’ work experience in a journal on corporate culture. “They had to go through psychological weaning after starting work.”

一位商业评论家毛丽娟在某期刊上的一篇文章中剖析了千禧年一代在企业文化中的工作经验，其中写道：“出生于八九十年代的人一直以来都由他们的父母来规划人生，难以从儿童身份中切换到职业工作身份，这些人得在开始工作后从精神上断奶。”

> If helicopter parenting hinders the socialization of the young, the effect is compounded by its narrow focus. While Chinese middle-class parents tirelessly push their children to work hard and master society’s hidden rules, they pay far less attention to emotional qualities like empathy. The education system, which pits students against one another in ruthless competition for spots at elite universities, does little to ease the problem.

假使密切的养育阻碍了这群年轻人融入社会，那么它狭隘的关注点更是加重了这种结果。中国的中产阶级父母不留余力地推动他们孩子努力工作，让他们掌握社会潜规则，但是这些父母很少关注在情绪上的一些品质，比如同情心。教育系统让学生在无情的竞争中相互对峙，只为在名牌大学有一席之位，但是对缓解情绪问题上做得微乎其微。

> It is not hard to understand why Chinese millennials, absorbing such lessons, are often blamed for their lack of concern for others.

中国千禧年一代从课程中吸取知识，但是常常受到指责，指责称他们对他人缺乏关心，这些都不难理解。

> Brimming youthful energy is mainly channeled into consumerism. Pouring money into everything from online games to cosmetics, millennials account for nearly half of China’s total private consumption, according to a report from the Boston Consulting Group.

年轻人大部分仅仅用消费主义来充能。根据一份来自波士顿咨询小组的报道，千禧年一代把钱挥霍在从网络游戏到整容的东西，这些人占比近中国个人总消费的一半之多。

> Their voracious appetite even spawned an annual ritual. One day every November, the Chinese go on an internet shopping spree to take advantage of steep discounts at e-commerce stores. It’s no coincidence that the date, Nov. 11, or 11/11, was picked for being a batch of lonesome 1s.

他们胃口大开甚至催生了一个年度仪式。在十一月的某天，中国人上网进行网购狂欢，去利用网店的超低折扣购物。十一月十一日，其是一组代表孤独的全为一的数字，这看起来并不是巧合。
