> In May 2015, 64 Asian-American organisations filed a complaint to this effect with the DoJ. The 50-page document argued that Asian applicants to Harvard “have 67% lower odds of admission than white applicants with comparable test scores” and, on the SAT, need 140 more points than whites, 270 more than Hispanics and 450 more than blacks to have the same chance of getting in. The groups cited Harvard’s “remarkable” stability in acceptance rates for Asians and juxtaposed it with the group’s steadily rising share of Harvard’s applicant pool. They claim this mismatch, along with flat acceptance lines for other demographic groups, suggests that Harvard seeks “proportional representation of the various racial and ethnic groups present in Harvard’s student body”.

2015年，64个亚裔美国人组织与司法部也提起类似的控诉。50页长的文件中提到申请进入哈佛大学的亚洲人与白人申请者相比在类似的考试分数上有67%的处于劣势的入学概率，其在美国学习能力测试上还要比白人多考140分，比西班牙人多考270分，比黑人多考450分以具有同样机会进入大学。这些团体援引了哈佛大学在录取率上针对亚洲人具有“非同一般”的稳定性并将其与哈佛大学稳定地扩大生源的现象作类比。这些团体称这种不相配性以及同时对其他人种群体更宽广的录取政策表明了哈佛大学寻求在其在校生上体现出不同种族和民族群体的比例代表现象。

> On August 2nd Sarah Isgur Flores, a DoJ spokesperson, said that the Obama administration had left this complaint against Harvard “unresolved” and that the civil-rights division of the office was seeking volunteers to reopen it. Ms Flores also corrected what she called “inaccurate” press reports of an internal DoJ memo that the department was about to launch an investigation of “university admissions in general”. Excerpts from the memo published by the New York Times a day earlier had suggested that the DoJ would look into and litigate “intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions”—a rather open-ended mission.

8月2日，司法部发言人萨拉伊斯格尔弗洛里斯称奥巴马政府将这份针对哈佛大学的诉讼搁置而未解决，总统办公室民权分部正物色志愿者以重新开启这份诉讼。弗洛里斯还纠正了些媒体报道，她认为这些报道中关于司法部内部备忘录的内容不准确，备忘录内容称本部将启动一项调查，去调查全国范围内的大学入学申请情况。备忘录摘录内容为纽约时报早于一天所报道，暗示着司法部将会调查和起诉学院和大学录取中有意识地区分种族的行为——这更是份永无止境的任务。

> If the DoJ is using the Harvard suit as a first step towards a wider-ranging investigation, it will be constrained, for now, by the Supreme Court’s narrow endorsement of admissions policies benefiting blacks and Hispanics. Since 1978, the court has said that while quotas are unconstitutional, universities seeking “the educational benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student body” may consider race.

假如司法部将这份哈佛大学的起诉作为进行大范围调查的第一步，那么它目前将会受到最高法院的限制，最高法院不知变通，支持对黑人和西班牙人有利的录取政策。自1978年以来，最高法院就一直称虽然名额限制不符合宪法，但是大学若从人种多样化的在校生中寻求教育利益，那么它们可以考虑种族。

> Last year Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in a case rebuffing a woman who complained that being white cost her admission to Texas’s flagship public university, where race is a modest factor in admitting a quarter of the student body. Universities are “laboratories for experimentation”, Justice Kennedy wrote. They are owed “considerable deference” in defining “intangible characteristics, like student body diversity.” But, he added, they must strive “to reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity.”

安东尼肯尼迪法官在去年在一场诉讼中书写主要意见书，断然拒绝了一名女士的控告，这位女士称白皮肤使她失去了进入德克萨斯州首屈一指的公立大学的机会，在此大学四分之一的在校录取生中种族因素影响不大。肯尼迪法官写道“大学是实验室，是用来试验的，”它们在界定“比如学生多样化上这种模糊抽象的特征上”缺少“很多应有的尊重。”不过这位法官还加了一句，称大学必须努力“在落实人种多样性与宪法承诺的平等待遇和尊严上达到协调一致。”

> The 81-year-old Justice Kennedy, whose vote upheld race-aware admissions last year, told prospective applicants for clerkships that he is considering retirement in 2018. If he hangs up his robe, his replacement will almost certainly share the four-justice conservative bloc’s distaste for affirmative action. That means the DoJ’s campaign against racial preferences may face a friendly majority by the time its lawsuits reach the Supreme Court.

肯尼迪法官今年81岁高龄了，他在去年高度赞同有种族意识的录取，他告诉未来的书记员申请者们他考虑到2018年退休。如果他真的退休了，那么他的继承人肯定会在积极区别对待政策上和四位保守派法官团体具有共同语言，对其反感。那就意味着司法部与种族偏见的斗争可能会在将诉讼上交到最高法院时深受一大批群众的赞赏。
