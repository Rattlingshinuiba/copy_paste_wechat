> IT IS risky to predict who and what will win a Nobel prize. But some discoveries are so big that their receipt of science’s glitziest gong seems only a matter of time. One such is CRISPR-Cas9, a powerful gene-editing technique that is making the fraught and fiddlybusiness of altering the genetic material of living organisms much easier.

预测哪个人和哪种东西会获得诺贝尔奖是件有风险的事，但是某些发现意义重大，它们能获得科学上闪闪发光的奖项看起来只是时间上的问题。其中一个例子就是CRISPR-Cas9,作为一种强大的基因编辑技术，它能使既让人焦虑又繁琐的对生物体基因原料进行改造的工作变得容易得多。

> Biologists have taken to CRISPR-Cas9 with gusto, first with animal experiments and now with tests on humans. In March researchers in China made history when they reported its first successful application to a disease-causing genetic mutation in human embryos. But their results were mixed. Although they achieved 100% success in correcting the faulty gene behind a type of anaemia called favism, they tested the technique in only two affected embryos. Of four others, carrying a mutation that causes thalassaemia, another anaemia, only one was successfully edited.

生物学家早就开始CRISPR-Cas9充满兴趣，首先就将其用到动物实验，现在把它用到人类身上来测试。中国研究者于三月取得历史性进展，宣布他们首次成功在人类胚胎上的某个致病突变基因上应用CRISPR-Cas9。不过其结果好坏参半。尽管他们在叫葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶缺乏症的贫血病上修复错误基因而取得百分百成功，但他们是在两个人工胚胎上测试此项技术。其它四个胚胎，其中都携有能致另一种叫地中海贫血症的突变基因，它们中只有一个成功编辑。

> Now, in a study just published in Nature, a group of researchers from America, China and South Korea have pulled off a similar trick, with striking consistency, among many more embryos, while avoiding or minimising several of the pitfalls of previous experiments. Their work suggests that, with a bit of tweaking and plenty of elbow grease, CRISPR-Cas9 stands a good chance of graduating, sooner or later, from the laboratory to the clinic.

现在，在刚刚发表在自然杂志的一项研究上，一个来自美国，中国和韩国的研究团体与刚提及的发现有惊人的一致性，也取得了相似的小伎俩，不过他们避免或者减小几个之前实验的隐患。他们研究表明，小小的改动加上大量体力活，CRISPR-Cas9才能有机会从实验室走向临床，这是早晚的事。
