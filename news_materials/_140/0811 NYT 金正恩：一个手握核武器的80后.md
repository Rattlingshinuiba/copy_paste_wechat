> SEOUL, South Korea — In China, the man threatening to fire missiles at the United States is often derided as a chubby brat. In the United States, a senator recently referred to him as “this crazy fat kid.” President Donald Trump once called him “a total nut job.”

有个男人，他威胁要向美国投放导弹，这个人在中国经常被嘲笑为“金三胖”。一名美国参议员近日将此男人称作“疯狂肥仔”。特朗普曾称他“一个十足的疯子”。

> But the target of all that scorn, Kim Jong Un, the 33-year-old leader of North Korea, has long been underestimated.

尽管金正恩是受尽各方嘲笑，这位33岁的朝鲜领导人长期以来为人们所低估了。

> Kim was the youngest of three sons yet leapfrogged his brothers to succeed his father, Kim Jong Il. Many analysts dismissed him as an inexperienced figurehead when he took power at 27; some predicted he would never last. But almost six years later, there is little doubt he is firmly in control.

金正恩是金正日三个孩子中最年轻的，但他超过哥哥，继承父位。许多分析师对他不屑一提，认为他在27岁掌权时就是个没经验的傀儡，也有一些分析师预测他掌权持续不了多长时间。但是约六年后，她毫无疑问地权力稳固。

> Now, against long odds, Kim is on the verge of making his isolated, impoverished nation one of very few in the world that can hit the United States with a nuclear-armed missile.

如今，尽管困难重重，金正恩马上就能使他与世隔绝，贫穷落后的国家成为世界上少有的能使用核载导弹打击的国家。

> Some have urged Trump to open negotiations with him. But it is unclear whether Kim is interested in talking. He has made building a nuclear arsenal a top priority, arguing that it is the only way the North can guarantee its security and develop its economy.

一些人就敦促川普让其与金正恩会谈。但是金正恩会不会对会谈感兴趣，这是尚未清楚的。金正恩将建造核军火库排到首选优先事项，声称这是使朝鲜保卫国家，发展经济的仅有保障。

> His ultimate motives, like many details of his life, are uncertain. Since taking power, Kim has yet to travel abroad or host a visit from another state leader. Only a few people outside North Korea have been allowed to meet with him — the former basketball star Dennis Rodman, a Japanese sushi chef, the vice presidents of Cuba.

他的最终目的就像他一生的许多事一样显得没有定数。自从掌权以后，金正恩还未走访外国或对来自其他国家的领导进行接待。只有小部分朝鲜以外的人经允许与金正恩见面——前棒球明星丹尼斯罗德曼，日本寿司主厨和古巴副主席。
