> NO TWO countries are doing more to strain the fabric of modern trade than America and Britain. President Donald Trump wants to rewrite the terms of America’s trade relationships with everyone from Mexico to South Korea. After its vote to leave the European Union, Britain faces having to negotiate fresh trade deals with both the EU and countries beyond.

世界上不存在哪两种国家像美国和英国这样把现代贸易结构给利用地不堪重负了。川普想着要与从墨西哥到韩国的每一国家去改写贸易关系的条款。在投票决定脱欧后，英国面对着要和欧洲以及其它国家协商新贸易条约的问题。

> The pair’s tone on trade is different: one wants to put “America First”, the other to create a “global Britain”. But both visions are predicated on the idea of striking swift, bilateral deals, and each has identified the other as the perfect partner. At a meeting of G20 leaders this month, Mr Trump spoke of a “powerful deal, great for both countries”, which would be done “very, very quickly”. On July 24th Liam Fox, Britain’s international trade secretary, met his American counterparts to start talks about a post-Brexit agreement. A day later the president tweeted his excitement: “Working on major Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. Could be very big & exciting. JOBS!”

这两国家对待贸易的语调不尽相同：一个想着要“美国优先”，另一个想着要建立“大英帝球”。不过两者的设想都以这样一想法为前提：不带拖沓的双边贸易，互认对方是没有瑕疵的伙伴。在G20峰会上，川普提到了一个“效力巨大，对双方有重要影响，一点都不拖泥带水的交易”（十分川普式的发言）。7月24日，时任英国国际贸易大臣的利亚姆福克斯与其美国同级官员会谈关于脱欧后协议。一天后川普又发推特来表达他的激动：“和英国一起在一笔大生意上合作，真是件又伟大又带劲儿的工作啊！”

> An agreement between Britain and America would be a good thing in principle. Tariffs are already pretty low, although Mr Trump may have his eye on a 10% tariff on cars imported from America. But differences in rules and standards impede the flow of goods and services, worth $227bn in 2016, between the two countries. In practice, however, Mr Trump and, especially, the Brexiteers suffer from several profound delusions.

基本上讲，美国与英国之间有一份协议是件好事。关税已经很低了，然而川普可能还希望美国出口汽车收10%关税。但是规定与标准上的差异阻碍了两国家之间在2016年的价值2270亿美刀的现金流动与服务流通。实际上川普，特别是脱欧派遭受了几个巨大骗局。
