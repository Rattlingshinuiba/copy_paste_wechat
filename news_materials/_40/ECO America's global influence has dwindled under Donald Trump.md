Manypeople find reassurance in the sober, capable **military men** who surround him (see article).

很多人从川普周围那清醒能干的军人中找到消除疑虑的因素。

Hischief of staff, his defence secretary and his national security adviser allunderstand the horrors of war and will stop him from doing anything rash, theargument goes.

有言论称，川普的参谋长、国防部长和国家安全顾问都明白战争的可怕之处，并且会阻止川普鲁莽行事。

Optimistseven speculate that he might emulate Ronald Reagan, by shaking up thediplomatic establishment, restoring America’s military muscle and projectingsuch strength abroad that a frightened, overstretched North Korea will crumblelike the Soviet Union.

持乐观观点的人甚至都预测出川普可能会效仿罗纳德·里根去调整外交上的当权派来恢复美国的军事实力并对外展示实力，结果会让既内心害怕又硬撑的朝鲜像苏联一样四分五裂。

Othersconfidently predict that even if he causes short-term damage to America’sstanding in the world, Mr Trump will be voted out in 2020 and things willreturn to normal.

其他人还自信地预测，即使川普短期内削弱了美国的世界地位，但他将会在2020年被投票淘汰，事态也将会回归正常。

Allthis is wishful thinking.

然而这都是一厢情愿。

Onsecurity, Mr Trump has avoided some terrible mistakes.

在国家安全上，川普已避免了一些大错。

Congress and the election-hacking scandal prevented him from pursuing a grand bargain with Vladimir Putin that might have left Russia’s neighbours at the Kremlin’s mercy.

国会和有关大选遭到黑客干预的丑闻防止他与普京达成一个可能会让俄国周边国家受制于俄罗斯的协议。

And he has apparently coaxed China to exert a little more pressure on North Korea to stop expanding its nuclear arsenal.

他似乎还劝说中国去向朝鲜施加些许压力以防止朝鲜扩大其核武器库。
