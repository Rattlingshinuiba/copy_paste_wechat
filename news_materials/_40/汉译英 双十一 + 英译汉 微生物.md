汉译英是ECO的10月28日leader栏目，可以看原文比对。

接下来的几周买家们的网上消费要创纪录了：中国有11月11日的光棍节，美国有“黑色星期五”，全世界也都在为圣诞节热身。十年来电子商务以每年20%的速度增长，撼动了从物流到消费品的各行各业。至于这意味着什么，美国的讨论最为激烈。



For those purchasers, a few weeks ahead will see a record high of their consumption online, which is a sign of China’s Singles Day on Nov. 11 and Black Friday in the US, as preparations are being made for Christmas across the world. For over a decade, at the rate of 20% annually, e-commerce delivers a eye-catching growth, touching virtually all sectors from logistics to consumer goods.  there is a heated debate over the implications of it.

That finding illustrates an important idea. In effect, the antibiotics are editing the collective bacterial genome by removing from it genes that somehow assist immunotherapy.

这个发现证明了一个重要的想法：实际上，抗生素将基因从细菌所共有的基因组中消除从而对其基因组进行编辑，而这些经去除的基因由于某种原因而辅助了免疫治疗。

Much effort is now going into developing ways of editing the human genome, in order to improve human health. This is hard to do.

为了改善人体健康，人们如今正竭力开发能编辑人类基因组的途径，然而这并不容易做到。

But editing the microbial genome, by adding or subtracting particular species—and thus the genes they carry—is in principle far easier.

但是增加或减少特定的菌种从而增加或减少它们所携带的基因去对微生物基因组进行编辑，理论上来说，可是要容易得多，

That, too, could lead to improvements in human health. And many hopeful firms are now pursuing this idea.

并且这也可能会改善人体健康，于是大量让人看到曙光的公司正在贯彻这一想法。
