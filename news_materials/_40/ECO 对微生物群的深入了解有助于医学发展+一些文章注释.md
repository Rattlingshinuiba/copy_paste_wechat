## ECO 对微生物群的深入了解有助于医学发展+一些文章注释

WHEN, at the turn of the century, the first human genomes were sequenced, many biologists felt they **had had delivered into their hands the keys** to unlocking numerous puzzles about disease.

世纪之交时，第一个人类基因组得到了测序，许多生物学家就以为他们获取了能解释大量有关疾病难题的钥匙。

注：**had had delivered into their hands the keys**

语序应该是 had had the keys delivered into their hands. 原文如此语序的原因是将句末的 to unlocking 与 keys 位置拉近 以 进行修饰。

Since then there has indeed been a fruitful effort to understand how the thousands of human genes which control hormones, enzymes and other molecules of the body serve to regulate health.

自那以后，人们付出努力去了解大量控制荷尔蒙、酶以及其它人体分子的人类基因是如何调控人体健康的，并且的确富有成果。

注：

fruitful effort“有成果的努力” 在中文中不常见，于是可以将fruitful 拿出来置后翻译，并effort 前进行增词：做出努力。比如：我们在XX方面做出了努力，并且结果也不错。（because "fruitful" is relating to good results, you can take it as "结果/成果不错" ）

But, in an unexpected turn of events, it is also now apparent that the human genome is not the only one to which attention should be paid. Human guts contain microbes, lots of them. Added together, the genes in these bugs’ genomes amount to perhaps 150 times the number in the human genome alone. If the bacteria in question were doing little more than swimming around digesting lettuce, this would be of small consequence. But they are doing much more than that.”

但是事态也发生了意想不到的变化，如今，人们也不难发现人类基因组不是要受到唯一关注的那一类。人体肠道中存在着大量微生物，如果这些微生物加在一块，那么其所含基因组的数量就可能相当于单独一个人类基因组数量的150倍。如果所说的这些细菌只不过是在正在消化的生菜周围游动，那么这看起来也不怎么重要。但它们所做的事情可不仅仅如此。

注：

1.

It is also now apparent //It 是形式主语。按照有些翻译理论，可以置后翻译→XXXX，这如今也显而易见→但是显得头重脚轻/不像人话，所以正说反译。



2.

little more than 理解这个词组应将重点放在 more 上， little 修饰more, than表示前后比较。

more= greater extent//little= to a very small degree/extent（有否定含义）

整体下来看相当于要比较的东西前后一致：only/just

不多不少，仅仅。

至于不翻译成与XX一样，是因为虽然意思一样，但是同时还要考虑语气。
