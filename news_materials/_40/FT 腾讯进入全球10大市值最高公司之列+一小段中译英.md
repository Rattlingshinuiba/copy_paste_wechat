Tencent has kept up the pace with tech rivals such as Facebook and Amazon with a 57 per cent year-on-year jump in third quarter earnings, as the Chinese tech company boosted ad revenues on the back of its popular mobile games and social media apps.

腾讯借助其颇受欢迎的手机游戏和社交媒体应用从而使广告收入大增，在这种情况下，这家中国科技公司在第三季度收入上同比猛增了57%，已与脸书和亚马逊这样的科技对手并驾齐驱。





意欲挑战亚马逊的竞争者可能也会采取类似的方式，缔结合作伙伴关系。沃尔玛（京东的另一个投资者）似乎正在采用京东的策略，借助谷歌的语音助手来销售产品，以此对抗亚马逊的Alexa。Facebook希望能让用户更方便地购买其广告中出现的商品。

  Competitors that attempt to challenge Amazon are likely to forge partnerships to mimic similar movements. Walmart, another investor of JD, seems to adopt JD’s strategy—using Google-created voice assistant to promote products—to compete against Amazon-owned Alexa. And Facebook seeks to sell commodities in its advertisements which users will more easily click on.
