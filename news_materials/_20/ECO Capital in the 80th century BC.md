> THE **one-percenters** are now gobbling up more of the pie in America—**that much is well known.** This trend, though disconcerting,is not unique to the modern era. A new study, by Timothy Kohler of Washington State University and 17 others, finds that inequality **may well**have been rising for several thousand years, at least in some parts of the world. The scholars examined 63 archaeological sitesand estimated the levels of wealth inequality in **the societies** whose remains were dug up, by studying the distributions of house sizes.

众人皆知，如今在美国，**高端人口**正分到更多的羹。虽然令人不安，但是这种势头可不仅仅专属于现代。华盛顿州立大学的蒂莫赛·可乐（Timothy Kohler）和另外17名人员进行了一项崭新的研究，研究发现，至少在世界上有些地区，不平等局面很可能几百年来一直在加剧。这些学者调查了63处考古地址，通过研究房子尺寸的分布，在遗体经挖掘出的各个群体中评估了财富的不平等程度。

> As a measure they used the Gini coefficient (a perfectlyequal society would have a Gini coefficient of zero). It rose from about 0.2around 8000BC in **Jerf el-Ahmar**,on the **Euphrates** inmodern-day Syria, to 0.5 in around 79AD in Pompeii. Data on burial goods,though sparse, point to similar trends.

他们使用基尼系数来进行评估。（一个完全平等的社会的基尼系数为零。）在流经现代叙利亚的幼发拉底河上有一处叫做Jerfel-Ahmar的流域，其中的庞贝城基尼系数从公元前约8000年的0.2增加到公元后约79年的0.5。虽然从掩埋的商品中获得的数据分散，但也表明出了类似的趋势。

> The researchers suggest agriculture is to blame. Thenomadic lifestyle is not conducive to wealth accumulation. Only when humans switched to farming did people truly begin to acquire material riches.Inequality rose steadily after the shift to settled agriculture, but **tailed off** in the Americas after around 2,500 years. In the old world, however, wealth inequality continued climbing for several millennia. That may be because Eurasiawas richer in large mammals that could be domesticated. Horses and oxen greatly improved farm productivity—but livestock were mainly owned by the rich (who could also rent them out). The agricultural revolution was good for humanitybut awful for egalitarians.

研究人员认为导致如此的原因就是农业。零散的生活方并不会使财富得到集中，而只有人类作出转变，进行农业耕作时，才会真正地开始获取物质财富。然而人们作出转变，进行固定的农业耕作后，不平等局面就稳步加剧了，但是过了约2500年，这种局面在美洲又逐渐削弱了。然而在古代，财富上的不平等在几千年来继续加剧，其原因可能是大型哺乳动物经过训化，让欧亚大陆地区变得更富有。马和牛大大发展了农业生产力，但是牲畜大部分为富人所有，这些富人又将牲畜出租。对人类来说，农业革命颇为有益，但对平等主义者来讲，农业革命颇为糟糕。
