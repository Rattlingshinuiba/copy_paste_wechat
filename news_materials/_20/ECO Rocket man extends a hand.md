> FOLLOWING a brief **hiatus** in its testing programme, North Korea launched a missilein **the small hours** of November 29th that, unlike any previous missile, appeared to be able to strike any city in America.

朝鲜的导弹测试计划经历了短暂的中止后，又在11月29日凌晨时分发射一枚导弹，然而这次与以往不一样，其似乎能打击美国的任一城市。

>  It was the third test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) since July, and the 20th missile test this year.

这是朝鲜自七月以来第三次，也是今年的第二十次洲际弹道导弹测试。

> After watching the launch, thecountry’s leader, Kim Jong Un, who had spent the previous day visiting acatfish farm, announced: “We have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power.”

朝鲜领导人金正恩观看导弹发射之后便宣布：“我们最终实现了完善国家核实力这项伟大又具有历史意义的事业，达成了建立导弹大国的目标。”金正恩前一天视察了鲇鱼养殖场。

> Mr Kim **eschewed** the extravagantly bellicose rhetoric he normallyindulges in after a successful missile launch. His “solemn declaration”emphasised that North Korea would be a “responsible nuclear power” that “would not pose any threat to any country and region” as long as the interests ofNorth Korea “are not infringed upon”. It sounded like a plea for North Korea to be respected as a nuclear state, not **vilified** as a pariah.

导弹发射成功后，金正恩若在平时就会宣讲颇具有好战意味的浮夸言辞，但是这次他有意回避了这种做法，而是进行了庄严宣告，其中强调只要朝方的利益未遭到侵害，就会成为一个“负责任的核大国”，并且“不会对任何国家和地区构成威胁”。这就听起来像是朝鲜在祈求要被视为一个有核国家，而不是遭到恶语中伤，受到外界遗弃。
