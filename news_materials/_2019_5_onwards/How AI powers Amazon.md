The courtroom battle in San Diego was supposed to last for weeks, if not months. It was over on the first day, April 16th. 

在圣地亚哥法庭上的较量本来应该会持续数周，甚至数月。`然而`，这场较量在4月16日，也就是第一天便结束了。

Evan Chesler, a lawyer for Qualcomm, a big chip designer, had only a few minutes left in his riposte to Ruffin Cordell, who represented Apple, a hardware giant, when it emerged that the two firms had agreed to a settlement. 

当得知两家公司已达成协议时，芯片商高通公司律师伊万·切斯勒(Evan Chesler)就剩几分钟来对答硬件巨头苹果公司律师鲁芬·科德尔(Ruffin Cordell)了。

This included a **one-off** payment from Apple to Qualcomm and the decision to “dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide”. 

该协议包括苹果给高通**一次性**付款，以及决定“驳回全球范围内所有两家公司的诉讼”

After a brief conference with the lawyers, the judge called off the trial and sent the jurors home.

法官与律师简短商谈后，就取消了庭审，打发陪审团成员回家。

`Thus ended` what was perhaps the most epic fight ever over intellectual property and royalty payments between two technology titans. 

这两个科技巨头间在知识产权和版税款间或许是最为史诗般的斗争就这样结束了。

It began more than two years ago, spanned the world and could have seen Qualcomm `pay billions in damages.` 

这场斗争开始于六年多前，范围涵盖全球，期间高通可能得`支付几十亿的赔偿金`。

More important, the settlement creates a new `balance of power` among big players in the industry as it <u>gears up to</u> install “fifth generation” (5g) mobile technology, which is supposed to **carpet** the world with a dense wireless fabric.

更重要的是，该协议创造了业内大型企业的新`均势`，因为其准备安装第五代移动技术。该技术据称会用密集无线网络覆盖全球。

The fight began in January 2017 when Apple sued Qualcomm in California and China, demanding more than $1bn in damages. 

第一场诉讼开始于2017年1月，苹果在加利福尼亚州和中国起诉高通，索要10多亿美元赔偿金。

`The iPhone-maker was unhappy about` how Qualcomm charges for its patents, many of which are needed to build a mobile phone. 

高通收取专利费，其专利大多数用来做移动手机，`苹果对此表示不满。`

Instead of demanding royalties from component-makers, Qualcomm collects them from device-makers, as a percentage of the retail price, typically 5%. 

高通没向部件制造商而是从设备制造商收取版税，通常占5%零售价。

The manufacturers have no choice but to pay because most also rely on Qualcomm’s “baseband processors”, the chips that manage a device’s wireless connection.

制造商别无选择，只能付钱，因为大多数仍依赖高通用于管理设备无线连接的“基频处理器”。

This, Apple argued, is an abuse of market power and a tax on innovation, because it is in effect levied on all new features, such as a better camera, even if these are unrelated to Qualcomm’s patents.

苹果称这是滥用市场力量，对创新征税，因为这实际上是对所有新特性(比如更棒的摄像头)征收税用，不管这些特性与高通专利是否有关。
