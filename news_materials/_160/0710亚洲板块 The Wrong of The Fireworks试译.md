WHEN North Korea claimed it was in the final stages of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at the beginning of the year, Donald Trump scoffed: “It won't happen.” So it was per-haps not a coincidence that North Korea chose America's independence day to test a device that it claimed was indeed an ICBM. Although the claim is technically correct, the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, will probably have to wait a few more years before he can brandish a missile ca-pable of delivering a nuclear warhead to Los Angeles or New York. The missile appears to have flown for 37 minutes before splashing down some 930km from its launch. According to David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists, it had a lofted (heightened) trajectory, reaching an altitude of 2,800km. On a more conventional trajectory, the same missile would have a range of about 6,700km. That would be enough to reach Alaska, but not Hawaii or California.

当NK17年伊始宣布其洲际导弹工程已进入最后阶段时，特朗普还嘲讽其痴人说梦。朝鲜选择美国独立日这一天去测试其声称货真价实的ICBM装置，这或许不是巧合。技术上来看这份声明是挑不出毛病的，不过金同学若想拥有具有能装载打击LL或NYC核弹头的导弹，他还要等上个几年。导弹在空中飞行历时37分钟，之后离其发射地点930km处落下。来自UCS的大卫赖特说这枚导弹轨迹之高接近了2800km。按正常的导弹发射轨迹来看，其应该远至6700km ，这足以到达阿拉斯加，但还到不了夏威夷或加州。
