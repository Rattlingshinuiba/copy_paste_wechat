## 继续昨天的Lexington

> Strikingly often, self-made Americans have stories to share about teenage jobs, involving alarm clocks clanging before dawn, aching muscles, stern bosses and soul-fortifying hours of boredom. In 1978, a record year in the annals of the Bureau of Labour Statistics, 72% of all teenagers were employed in July, the peak month for youthful ice-cream scooping, shelf-stacking and burger-flipping. But for two decades the traditional summer job has been in decline, with 43% of teens working in July 2016.

自力更生的美国人总会有年轻时的工作经历拿来分享：破晓前当当作响的闹钟，干完体力活后酸痛的肌肉，严厉的上司和无聊时的思考人生。劳动统计局的年鉴记录了1978年青少年的情况，在他们当中有72%的人在7月受到雇佣，这是青少年雇佣量达到顶峰的一月，工作包括做冰淇淋，整理货架，炸肉饼。但20年来，传统暑期工数目处于下滑状态，2016年7月仅有43%的青少年做零工。

> Lexington decided to head to Dixon to ask why. This being an anxious and litigious age, Reagan’s river beach is closed now. But the YMCA that trained him in lifesaving (and where he paraded as a drum major) still hires lifeguards. This summer finds one of them, Lexi Nelson, 18, between high school and community college, where she will study dental hygiene. Perhaps a quarter of her friends are working this season. The rest have mixed views of her job, which can start at five in the morning. “When I get up early they bash on it,” Miss Nelson reports, “but most of the time they’re jealous of the money.” Lifeguarding in an indoor pool is not the most exciting job, she concedes, but that teaches patience.

本版块记者决定前往迪克松一探究竟。在这本应渴望万物和热衷争辩的年代，代表里根的河滩如今已关闭。不过基督教青年会仍雇佣救生员，当年里根在会里培训习得救生术，同时也在这里当过鼓手指挥。这个夏天在会里当救生员的其中一名年轻人叫做莱希纳尔逊，她今年18岁了，刚高中毕业并即将进入社区大学学习口腔卫生学。她大概有四分之一的朋友在这个季节打工。她早上要五点开始工作，剩下的朋友对她工作的看法好坏兼有。她说：“当我早早起床，他们就借此抨击，不过大多时间他们还是很眼红的。”她承认在室内游泳池当救生员看起来不是最令人兴奋的，不过这教会了她耐心。

> The story of the vanishing job is not a simple one. Ask teenagers, their employers and the mayor of Dixon—a business-owner who hires teenagers each summer at a pair of sandwich shops and a frozen yogurt store—and they point to two main causes: well-meaning adults and a changing economy.

工作越来越少，这不仅仅是个简单的故事。我们一一问了年轻人，老板和地克松市的市长——每个夏天雇佣青少年去三明治店和冰冻酸奶店干活的商业家——然后他们指出两个主要原因：出于好意的大人和处于变化的经济。

> Reagan’s stirring example is still taught in Dixon, a trim, conservative town, with an equestrian statue of the president on its riverfront and loudspeakers on lamp-posts that play the Carpenters and other easy-listening classics. But many parents discourage teens from working, it is widely agreed. Parents instead tell their children to study, take summer courses, volunteer or practise for sports that might help them compete for college places.

里根的励志故事仍在当地被用来学习。迪克松市市容整齐又守旧，河滨处屹立着里根的骑马雕像，路灯挂着喇叭，放着卡普特乐队和其他轻松悦耳的经典老歌。然而人们普遍认为许多父母都阻止青少年去工作。父母们让他们的孩子学习，上暑期班，志愿服兵役或者训练体育以让孩子们在大学校园呈现出完美形象。
