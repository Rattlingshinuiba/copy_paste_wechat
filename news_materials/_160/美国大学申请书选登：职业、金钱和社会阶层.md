## 美国大学申请书选登：职业、金钱和社会阶层

梦雨 [梦雨的ENG外刊乱炖](javascript:void(0);) *2017-07-22*

> At age 6, I remember the light filled openness of the house, how the whir of my mother’s vacuum floated from room to room. At 9, I remember how I used to lounge on the couch and watch Disney cartoons on the sideways refrigerator of a TV implanted in a small cave in the wall. At 12, I remember family photographs of the Spanish countryside hanging in every room. At 14, I remember vacuuming each foot of carpet in the massive house and folding pastel shirts fresh out of the dryer.

我还记得6岁时阳光洒满宽敞的房子，老妈拿着吸尘器，嗡嗡声音从这屋飘到那屋。我还记得9岁时自己躺在沙发上看着迪士尼卡通片，电视机犹如过道的冰箱那么大，被嵌在墙内的小洞内。我还记得12岁时一家人在西班牙乡间旅游的照片，它们挂在每一个房间。我还记得14岁时我在偌大的房子里用吸尘器处理地毯的每一角落和从烘干器下取出并叠起刚弄好的柔色衬衫。

> I loved the house. I loved the way the windows soaked the house with light, a sort of bleach against any gloom. I loved how I could always find a book or magazine on any flat surface.

我爱这房子，爱在阳光透过窗户，充满整个房间，像是某种漂白剂除去任何阴暗；爱在我可以在任一平面上找到一本书籍或一本杂志。

> But the vacuum my mother used wasn’t ours. We never paid for cable. The photographs weren’t of my family. The carpet I vacuumed I only saw once a week, and the pastel shirts I folded I never wore. The house wasn’t mine. My mother was only the cleaning lady, and I helped.

但老妈用的吸尘器不属于我们。我们从来没付钱买有线电台。照片中的人不是我们一家人。我用吸尘器清理地毯，而地毯我一周就见过一次，还有我从来没穿过叠的柔色衬衫。这座房屋不属于我。我妈仅仅是一名清洁工，而我是助手。

> My mother and father had come as refugees almost twenty years ago from the country of Moldova. My mother worked numerous odd jobs, but once I was born she decided she needed to do something different. She put an ad in the paper advertising house cleaning, and a couple, both professors, answered. They became her first client, and their house became the bedrock of our sustenance. Economic recessions came and went, but my mother returned every Monday, Friday and occasional Sunday.

我父母大概二十年前从摩尔瓦多逃离到这里成为难民。我妈干了大量零工，但我一出生她决定需要做点不同的工作。她张贴广告，要做房屋清扫，之后一对教授夫妇答应。他们成了我妈的第一个客户，他们的房屋成为我们生计的支柱。经济衰退来了又去，但我妈每周一和五偶尔周六回来。

> She spends her days in teal latex gloves, guiding a blue Hoover vacuum over what seems like miles of carpet. All the mirrors she’s cleaned could probably stack up to be a minor Philip Johnson skyscraper. This isn’t new for her. The vacuums and the gloves might be, but the work isn’t. In Moldova, her family grew gherkins and tomatoes. She spent countless hours kneeling in the dirt, growing her vegetables with the care that professors advise their protégés, with kindness and proactivity. Today, the fruits of her labor have been replaced with the suction of her vacuum.

她整天戴着天青色乳胶手套，操控着蓝色胡佛吸尘器清理看起来有几英里的地毯。可能她清理过的所有玻璃可以和菲利普约翰逊的摩天大楼相媲美。这对她来说并不新鲜。吸尘器和手套或许新鲜，但这份工作不是。在摩尔瓦多，我家种着黄瓜和西红柿。她花费无数时间在泥土那跪着悉心培育她的蔬菜，就像教授带着关心又主动地给学生提意见一样。她辛劳培育的果实现在由吸尘器的真空替代了。

> The professors’ home was a telescope to how the other (more affluent) half lived. They were rarely ever home, so I saw their remnants: the lightly crinkled New York Times sprawled on the kitchen table, the overturned, half-opened books in their overflowing personal library, the TV consistently left on the National Geographic channel. I took these remnants as a celebrity-endorsed path to prosperity. I began to check out books from the school library and started reading the news religiously.

教授的家就像一个望远镜，从中可以看到其他更富裕的一半人的生活。他们很少在家，所以我看到他们的痕迹：轻微上翘的纽约时报摊在厨房桌上，打开一半的书倒扣在他们堆满东西的个人实验室，电视机一直停留在国家地理频道。我把这些痕迹当作由明星代言的通过繁荣的星光大道。我开始从图书馆借书，虔诚地读报刊新闻。

> Their home was a sanctuary for my dreams. It was there I, as a glasses-wearing computer nerd, read about a mythical place called Silicon Valley in Bloomberg Businessweek magazines. It was there, as a son of immigrants, that I read about a young senator named Barack Obama, the child of an immigrant, aspiring to be the president of the United States. The life that I saw through their home showed me that an immigrant could succeed in America, too. Work could be done with one’s hands and with one’s mind. It impressed on me a sort of social capital that I knew could be used in America. The professors left me the elements to their own success, and all my life I’ve been trying to make my own reaction.

他们家就是我梦想的庇护所。我是一个戴眼镜的电脑怪胎，在那里从彭博商业周刊读着一个叫做硅谷的神秘之地。我是一个来自移民的儿子，在那我读着一个叫做奥巴马的年轻参议员，他也是一个移民的孩子，立志称为美国总统。我从他们的家里看到的生活告诉了我一个移民也可以在美国成功。只有有一双手和一颗心同样可以工作。我明白了某种社会资本可以在美国使用的深刻观点。教授留下了他们自己成功的要素，我的一生一直努力做出自己的回应。

> Ultimately, the suction of the vacuum is what sustains my family. The squeal of her vacuum reminds me why I have the opportunity to drive my squealing car to school. I am where I am today because my mom put an enormous amount of labor into the formula of the American Dream. It’s her blue Hoover vacuums that hold up the framework of my life. Someday, I hope my diploma can hold up the framework of hers.  

最终，吸尘器支持着我的家庭。她的吸尘器刺耳尖叫，告诉着我能有机会开着自己吱呀作响的车来上学的原因。我能有今天，是因为我的妈妈付出了大量的辛劳，注入进美国梦的公式。她的蓝色胡佛吸尘器支撑起了我生活的框架。我希望将来某一天我的学位证能够支撑起她生活的框架。
