## 为濒临消亡的万物留念

> A GROWING CONSENSUS among scientists holds that we now live in the Anthropocene, an epoch defined by humanity’s impact on planetary ecosystems. We are responsible for the current die-off of species, not some asteroid or volcanic eruption. The changes go far beyond animal disappearance: We’ve altered the composition of the atmosphere, shifted the chemistry of the oceans.

科学家日益赞同认为我们活在人类纪，即一个人类影响地球生态系统的时期。我们造成了如今物种的灭绝，而不是类行星或火山爆发。变化远不止动物消亡：我们改变了大气组分还有海洋的化学物质。

> In mere decades we’ve managed to distort a biological, chemical and physical reality that was relatively constant for millenniums. And now, in the face of these unfathomable transformations, we are trying desperately to hang onto and preserve what remains.

仅仅几十年间我们亲手扭曲了相对稳定数千年的生物，化学和物理现实。而现在我们面对地这些难以参透的改变，试图竭力保住和保护存留下来的东西。

> Academics have even taken to studying the psychology of this human response — one such book, for example, is titled “The Anthropology of Extinction: Essays on Culture and Species Death.” In certain ways, our environmental banks are cabinets of curiosity for the Anthropocene age, tributes to the fantastical magnificence of the world in this geologic moment just as that moment is passing.

乃至学者已着手研究人类反应的心理，举个例子，有本书书名叫做《灭绝人类学：文化与物种死亡的文章》。某种程度上，我们所建的环境库是人类纪元的新奇小屋，在这个正将走完的地质时刻献上我们对这迷人又宏伟的世界的最后敬意。
