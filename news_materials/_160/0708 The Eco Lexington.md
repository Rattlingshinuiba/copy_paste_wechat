> THE first time that Ronald Reagan appeared on a newspaper front page was as a teenage lifeguard, hailed for saving a drowning man from a fast-flowing river. The future president was not yet “Ronnie”, America’s reassuring, twinkling, optimist-in-chief. He was still “Dutch”, to use his childhood nickname: a slim, bespectacled youth, serious to the point of priggishness.

罗纳德里根年轻时当过救生员，他将一名溺水男子从湍急河流中救了起来，因而受到褒奖且第一次上了报纸头条。这位未来的总统让人安心，眼神中透露着幽默，又扛着积极乐观的大旗，不过当时他还不叫“罗尼”。他当时用的是儿时小名“达奇”：瘦瘦的，戴眼镜，有点傲气但也有傲骨的小毛孩。

> A biographer, Garry Wills, unearthed a high school yearbook in which Reagan scolded swimmers he pulled from the cool, treacherous Rock River, near his boyhood home of Dixon, Illinois. “A big hippopotamus with a sandwich in each hand, and some firewater tanked away,” Reagan wrote of one. Each summer from 1927 to 1932 the teenager would rise early to collect a 300lb block of ice and hamburger supplies before driving in his employer’s van to the river, working 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The post offered responsibility, money for college and stability in a childhood blighted by frequent moves, brushes with financial ruin and his father’s drinking. There was glory, too: in all he saved 77 lives. A picture of the Rock River hung in Reagan’s Oval Office.

一名叫盖里威尔斯的传记家发现一本学校年刊，里面讲述了里根的童年住在伊利诺斯州的迪克松市，他从离家不远处的罗克河中把那些落水者救上岸，并一一在这本刊物上贬损，其中一处写道：“这人他一手一个三明治，灌酒灌得醉醺醺的，活生生是一只河马。”1927到1932的每年夏天这位年轻人都会去收集300磅重的大冰块还有汉堡，开着他老板的面包车来到这条河流，一周无休，每天干12小时。这份工作让他有了责任，赚得的钱得以去上大学，以及让他在不断的搬家，短暂的支出困难还有酗酒的老爹笼罩的阴影之间不至于太过动摇。同时他还有在这条河救了77条生命的荣誉。在里根的总统办公室还有一张罗克河的照片挂在上面。
