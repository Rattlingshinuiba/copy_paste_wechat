The fortunes of extremist candidates have faltered since the populist surge that put Donald Trump into the White House. But it is hard to be confident that this was populism’s high-water mark without a better understanding of what caused the swell in the first place. The most convincing explanations suggest that populist upswings are not in the past.

> 马琳勒庞试图当选法国总统，结果失败了，发达国家的当权政客们为此安心地舒了口气。自民粹之潮将特朗普入驻白宫后，政见极端的候选者运气削弱了不少。但若不甚了解究竟是什么造成了民粹的壮大，就很难有底气认为民粹主义已到最高水位不再上升。最具说服力的解释认为呈壮大趋势的民粹主义者没有停留在过去。



>  It is tempting to dismiss the rise of radicalism as an inevitable after-effect of the global financial crisis. Studies show that the vote shares of extreme parties, particularly on the right, tend to increase in the years after a crisis. The Depression spawned some of the 20th century’s most dangerous and radical populist movements. But the facts do not fit that story precisely.  In Europe, for example, populist parties have steadily won more voters since the 1980s. What is more, populist rage is rarely focused on finance.Trade and immigration are more prominent targets. The clearest recent manifestations of the populist surge—Mr Trump’s victory and Brexit—have only an indirect link to the financial crisis.

全球金融危机造成了极端主义是不可挡的崛起，人们倾向对这种现象不予理会。研究表明在危机过后数年内特别是极右派别得到的票数有增加的趋势。大萧条造成了一些20世纪最危险极端的民粹运动，但发生的事实不仅仅只包括这个例子，再举个例子，从20世纪80年代起民粹党派就受到越来越多选民的支持。更进一步的讲，民粹主义者很少集中火力在财政上。最能清楚展现民粹主义者浪潮的事件——川普当选和英国脱欧——与金融危机只有间接联系。
