> IN 1953 B.F. Skinner visited his daughter’s maths class. The Harvard psychologist found every pupil learning the same topic in the same way at the same speed. A few days later he built his first “teaching machine”, which let children tackle questions at their own pace. By the mid-1960s similar gizmos were being flogged by door-to-door salesmen. Within a few years, though, enthusiasm for them had fizzled out.

伯尔赫斯·弗雷德里克·斯金纳于1953年拜访了女儿的数学课，发现学生们都以同样速度同样方式学习同样的课题。没过几天后他制作了第一个教育机器以让孩子们以他们自己的速度解决问题。直到20世纪60年代中期，这种类似的小玩意由串门的销售员不停兜售。然而没过几年，人们对它们的热情已消失殆尽。

> Since then education technology (edtech) has repeated the cycle of hype and flop, even as computers have reshaped almost every other part of life. One reason is the conservatism of teachers and their unions. But another is that the brain-stretching potential of edtech has remained unproven.

自那以后教育技术就一直进行着大起大落的循环，尽管当时计算机使几乎除教育之外的每一领域焕然一新。其原因之一有老师和其工会的保守。但另一原因是教育技术开发大脑的潜能仍未得到证实。

> Today, however, Skinner’s heirs are forcing the sceptics to think again (see page 16). Backed by billionaire techies such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, schools around the world are using new software to “personalise” learning. This could help hundreds of millions of children stuck in dismal classes—but only if edtech boosters can resist the temptation to revive harmful ideas about how children learn. To succeed, edtech must be at the service of teaching, not the other way around.

   不过如今斯金纳的后代正促使怀疑论者重新思考。一款能个性化学习的新软件正风靡世界各地学校，这些学校得到了拥有十亿资产的科技迷 马克扎克伯格和比尔盖茨的支持。一亿多受糟糕课堂所拖累的儿童将会如鱼得水，不过前提是教育技术的推动者能抵住诱惑，不萌生关于孩子学习方式的不利想法。教育技术必须以教育服务为本，而不是在其他方法上走岔路，这才是成功之道。
