> You may have heard that the few hundred year old definition of “tip”, as referring to gratuity, comes from “To Insure Promptness” or similar backronyms, but this isn’t correct.
>
> In fact, pretty much anytime you’ve ever heard of a word that originated before the 20th century coming from an acronym, you can be almost certain that it isn’t true.

或许你听说过具有几百年历史的"tip"——也就是服务小费——这个词来自TO INSURE PROMPTNESS,即确保及时服务，抑或其他的逆向构词，然而这种说法并不正确。

实际上，任何时候你若听到一个起源于20世纪之前的单词来自缩写词，那么你就可以确定那就是在扯犊子。

> As linguist David Wilton said,

> There is only one known pre-20th-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is “colinderies” or “colinda”, an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year.

  正如语言学家大卫威尔顿所说：“20世纪之前只有一个具有缩写词词源的单词，它在1886年风靡了一小段时间。这个词就是当年出现于伦敦的Colinderies或colinda，全称是Colonial and Indian Exposition.”（这个在网上没有中文的考据，维基英文给的解释大致是殖民时期英国维多利亚女王举办的展览会）

> The real origin of the word “tip” is a bit more obscure than that. In terms of the “gratuity” definition, it most likely comes from a popular form of speech among thieves, beggars, and hustlers, called the “Thieves’ Cant” (also sometimes called “Rogues’ Cant”), which arose in Great Britain several hundred years ago with the primary aim of keeping non-thieves and the like from being able to fully understand what the thieves were talking about.

tip的真正词源比刚才所提及的词更加的模糊。从“gratuity”（小费）这个意思来看，tip最可能来自流行于小偷，乞丐和性工作者之间的一种修辞，称为小偷术语或地痞术语，出现在几百年前大英帝国，其主要目的是防止不是小偷或诸如此类的人能够明白小偷们讨论的话。



> One such slang word in this Thieves’ Cant was “tip”, meaning “to give or to share”. The first documented usage of “tip” this way dates back to 1610.
>
> At some point within the next century, this sense of the word spread to being used by non-thieves as referring to money given as a bonus for service rendered, with the first documented instance of this definition popping up in 1706 in the George Farquhar play, *The Beaux Stratagem*, “Then I, Sir, tips me the Verger with half a Crown…”
>
> As to the ultimate origin of the word “tip” in English, meaning anything, it first popped up in the 13th century meaning “end, point, top”, probably from the Middle Dutch word “tip”, meaning “utmost point or extremity”.

tip作为小偷术语而成为一个俚语，意思是“to give or to share"（给予或分享）。首次记录下来的tip用法可以追溯到1610年。

接下来的一个世纪的一段时间，这次单词的意思流传并为非小偷的人用来指代提供服务的奖赏，其记录这此个定义的例子首次出现在1706年乔治法夸尔的戏剧中的一句话：“那么阁下请赏点钱吧。”
