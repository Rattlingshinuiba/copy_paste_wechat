“英语精读课上当初老师讲解成中文也让人一脸懵逼的文章”

> It was principally the influence of Christianity that deprived beauty of the central place it had in classical ideals of human excellence. By limiting excellence to moral virtue only, Christianity set beauty adrift —— as an alienated, arbitrary, superficial enchantment. And beauty has continued to lose prestige. For close to two centuries it has become a convention to attribute beauty to only one of the two sexes: the sex which, however Fair, is always Second. Associating beauty with women has put beauty even further on the defensive, morally.

Beauty本身的核心含义是指人的杰出，因其主要受基督教的影响而发生改变。基督教将Beauty原有的杰出之意定义在道德之美，这造成了其在意思上缺少了依据性：陌生，随意，仅仅代表皮囊的迷人外表。不过这还没完，Beauty继续褪去其原有的光环。近两个世纪以来人们开始习以为常地将Beauty只划分给性别的一方：你可以说它公平起见，不过这一性别始终是代表次要的一方。我们将Beauty归类在女性身上，这使得Beauty在道德上更有种缺少主动的意味。

  

>  A beautiful woman, we say in English. But a handsome man. “Handsome” is the masculine equivalent of ——and refusal of——a compliment which has accumulate certain demeaning overtones, by being reserved women only. That one can call a man in French and in Italian suggests that catholic countries, unlike those countries shaped by the Protestant version of Christianity, still retain some vestiges of the pagan admiration for beauty. But the differences, if one exists, is of degrees only. In every modern country that is Christian or post-Christian, women are the beautiful sex ——to the detriment of the notion of beauty as well as of women.

 我们形容女人Beautiful，这不足为奇，不过换成男人的话，我们用的是Hansome.Hansome代表着阳刚之气，但同时也不能算是美誉，因为一针对起女性，它就背负有某种贬低的意味。与清教派构建的国家不同，天主教派的国家仍保留些许对Beauty的世俗仰慕，比如在法国和意大利的人就说男人Beautiful的，即使这有反例，也只是表现在某种程度上的。无论是基督还是后基督的现代国家都认为女性是Beautiful的，这不仅对Beauty的观念还对女性本身都是一种贬损。

  “昨天NYT的哈佛大学社团出幺蛾子的报道”  

> A committee is considering a recommendation that could fundamentally change the social fabric of Harvard.
>
> The committee, of faculty and staff members and students, suggested calling for numerous exclusive social clubs — including the secretive “final clubs,” fraternities and sororities — to be “phased out” over the next five years. If enacted, the recommendation would end a centuries-old tradition of rarefied clubs at a university that have been criticized as deeply exclusionary.

哈佛大学某委员会正考虑一项可能从根本上改变学校社交结构的提议。

委员会建议并呼吁院系师生共同努力将包括秘密组织的“终极社团”和“兄弟姐妹会”在内的大量不对外开放的社团五年内逐步废除。假若该提议得以通过，存在哈佛大学数百年来饱受批评其排外的小众社团将会走向终结。

> A preliminary recommendation circulated to students and faculty members on Wednesday would bar students from joining “final clubs, fraternities or sororities, or other similar private, exclusionary social organizations.” Since Harvard has not recognized the groups for decades, the committee’s suggestion would, if enacted, try to eliminate the clubs by punishing the students who participate in them.

本周三此提议初步的计划在院系学生与教职工间流传下来：禁止学生再加入“终极社团”，“兄弟姐妹会”或其他诸如此类的地下，不对外开放的社交组织。委员会再次强调倘若提议通过，将会对参加这些社团的学生施加惩罚措施，更何况哈佛大学几十年来从未认可此类社团。
