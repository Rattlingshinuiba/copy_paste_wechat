## 最近NYT ECO 的三篇 试译

梦雨 [梦雨的ENG外刊乱炖](javascript:void(0);) *2017-07-13*

三篇中最满意的是第一篇，因为尽量要做到直译，而意译是为确保中文习惯才要做的。以下加起来大概花了一个半小时，三笔的英译汉要求是300到400词一小时。

> Iraq’s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, and Iraqi security forces deserved to celebrate after re-establishing control over Mosul, which the Islamic State occupied for three years in its bloody quest for a caliphate. The celebration should be brief. There is still plenty of urgent work to be done — by Iraqis, the United States, regional neighbors and others — to stabilize Iraq and Syria while also working to counter ISIS’ insidious ideology. And a new report about the high civilian casualty rate demands that President Trump and the Pentagon rethink how the war is being fought.

IS不顾生灵涂炭地追求哈里发，占领了摩苏尔长达三年之久。在重新夺回摩苏尔后，伊拉克总理海德尔阿巴迪和国家安全部队值得为此庆祝，不过这场庆祝可能也就只有那么一小段时间。这仍存在着需要由伊拉克，美国，周边国家以及其他地区处理的大量亟待解决的问题：不仅要保持伊拉克和叙利亚的稳定还要和IS潜在的意识形态作斗争。某一关于平民高阵亡率的最新报道要求特朗普和美国国防部重新思考这场战争是如何进行的。

下面这一篇是最近的邮件事件，试着以通俗小报的口吻来翻译。

> All along, the truth was right there in the emails — Donald Trump Jr.’s emails, that is, which he released publicly on Twitter Tuesday morning after learning that The New York Times was about to publish their contents.
>
> In language so blunt and obvious it would make a Hollywood screenwriter blush, the emails confirm what the president, his son and others have denied repeatedly for more than a year: that top members of the Trump campaign met with representatives of the Russian government in the expectation of help in damaging Hillary Clinton and getting Donald Trump elected.

自始自终，一切尽在不言中，其尽在川普儿子小川普的邮件中，这可是他得知本报刊想刊登邮件内容后于周二早上抢先一步在他的推特上公开的。

邮件其措辞之扎心，内容之辣眼睛，可谓使得好莱坞编剧们都羞愧不如，川普和他儿子以及相关人士持续了一年多一直不停地否认传闻大选团队高层人员与俄国政府代表串通一气让其为打败希拉里克林顿和高升唐纳德特朗普上助一臂之力，现在邮件告诉他们：妥了。

本期ECO的封面文章不算难，不过就当作泛读而意译了前两段。

> THE battle-lines are drawn. When the world’s big trading nations convene this weekat a G20 summit in Hamburg, the stage is set for a clash between a protectionist America and a free-trading Germany.

世界上最大的贸易国家于本周在汉堡举办的20国峰会上得以会见，同时阵营界限也已被划分，一方是贸易保护主义者美国以及自由贸易者德国，峰会俨然成为双方冲突的擂台。

> President Donald Trump has already pulled out of one trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership,and demanded the renegotiation of another, the North American Free-Trade Agreement. He is weighing whether to impose tariffs on steel imports into America, a move that would almost certainly provoke retaliation. The threat of a trade war has hung over the Trump presidency since January. In contrast, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor and the summit’s host, will bang the drum for free trade. In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump, she delivered a speech on June 29th condemning the forces of protectionism and isolationism. An imminent free-trade deal between Japan and the European Union will add substance to her rhetoric.

川普此前已退出TPP协议，同时也要求重新协商NAFTA协议。川普在考虑是否要加大钢铁进口的关税，不过此举会无疑造成对方的强有力回应。从一月以来的川普任职期间，贸易战威胁就没有褪去困扰的势头。相比之下德国总理默克尔会极力支持自由贸易，她在6月29日的演讲中抨击贸易保护主义和孤立主义，含沙射影地在针对特朗普。日本和欧盟的自由贸易协定更加让她有了底气。
