## 继续昨天的里根和一篇NYT

> Local keepers of the Reagan flame see a town still filled with opportunities for self-advancement. Patrick Gorman, director of the Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home, a museum that preserves a house rented by the president’s family in Dixon, is confident that anyone who wants a job can find one, even if it might be “detasseling” corn—picking pollen tassels from growing corn cobs, an arduous summer task traditionally reserved for the young, involving cold mornings, baking middays and scratches from corn leaves. Mr Gorman easily found six teenagers to volunteer as museum guides: “Good kids migrate to good kids,” he beams.

当地秉持里根精神的人（里根曾获得The Keeper of the Flame即火焰守护者奖，这里用转喻指代关于里根的某种东西）仍认为一座城仍具备发展的机会。帕特里克戈尔曼管理着罗纳德里根童年之家，这座博物馆保存有当时在迪克松时里根家庭曾租用的一间房屋，这位馆长自信地认为只要有人想找工作，那么肯定能找到，不过这些工作中包括去玉米穗，即从生长的玉米棒子芯中拿去花粉须，这是个在传统中特地为年轻人保留的一项艰苦的夏季任务，包括寒冷的早晨，炽热的中午和拔无尽的玉米叶子。格尔曼不费多少力就找到六名志愿当博物馆向导的年轻人，他喜笑颜开：“物以类聚，人以群分啊。”

> Not all teenagers have the same needs. The three lifeguards interviewed at the YMCA are either college-bound or plan to be, and part-time work suits them. Bosses at the “Y” note that youngsters with only a high-school education typically have a different goal: landing a full-time job with health insurance and benefits.

不是所有的年轻人都对以上这类工作有需求。三名在基督教青年会接受采访的救生员要么是准大学生要么正在备考，做兼职对他们来说再也适合不过。会里的管理者在日志中写到只有高中学历的那些年轻人的目标通常截然不同：努力获得一份对自己有好处的全职健康保险工作。

**美国的教育**



> Long before the federal government roused itself, individual state governments were fighting to bring discipline to an unruly and untrustworthy corner of the educational market — for-profit schools that saddle students with crushing debt in exchange for degrees that are essentially useless.

在联邦政府成立的很久以前，各个州政府还正努力整顿教育市场中无法无天，不值得信任的某些只顾利益的学校，学生被搞地负债累累，只为得到那毫无作用的一纸文凭。

> The states are still fighting the good fight: In a lawsuit filed last week in Federal District Court in Washington, attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia served notice that they will resist any attempt by the Trump administration to weaken or ignore hard-won regulations that protect students and taxpayers from predatory schools.

现如今各个州仍在为此正义之举而奋斗：上周华盛顿的联邦区法庭有一起诉讼，来自19个州还有哥伦比亚特区的首席法律顾问声名他们将会反对特朗普政府的一切企图削弱或忽视来之不易的法规条令的行为，这些条令使得学生和纳税人拜托那些弱肉强食的学校。

> One such attempt has already been identified. This spring, the Education Department abruptly suspended federal rules that allow students who have been defrauded by colleges to have their federal loans forgiven. The state coalition, led by Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts, says that in so doing the department broke the law. The suit asks the court to declare the action illegal and to order the department to implement the rule without delay.

在诉讼之前就已发生这种不良企图的行为。今年春天教育部突然暂停执行联邦法规中关于在校被诈骗的学生可申请取消偿还联邦贷款的内容。麻萨诸塞州的首席法律顾问莫拉希累认为教育部的这种行为是违规的。诉讼要求法庭宣判这种行为属于非法并命令教育部立即履行此项法规。
