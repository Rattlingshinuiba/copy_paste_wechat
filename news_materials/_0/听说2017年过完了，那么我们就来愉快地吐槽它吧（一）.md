> Our most widely read explainer of the year was divisive. Its tongue-in-cheek title pointed to a lamentable conclusion: the best way to become very rich in America is to be born into wealth. The next best way is to marry into money. Going to a top university is a possible route to riches, but a far from certain one. Some readers were disappointed that this piece didn’t offer any practical advice. Yet the fact of economic mobility in today’s America is that there isn’t any such advice to give.     

今年我们阅读最广泛的一篇文章可引起了不小的争议。这标题看起来毫不严肃，但指出了一个扎心的结论：在美国，要变得富得流油，最佳途径便是生而为富，而下一个途径则是和钱财喜结连理。考上一个顶尖大学是个可能致富的套路，然而这远远不是一个板上钉钉的途径。一些读者感到失望，觉得这篇文章没给出任何实用建议。然而，今日美国，关于经济流动性的真相便是：实用建议?不存在的。
