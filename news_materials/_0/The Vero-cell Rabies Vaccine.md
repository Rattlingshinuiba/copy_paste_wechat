China’s drug watchdog has told the country’s second-biggest maker of rabies vaccines to stop production after a snap inspection uncovered evidence of forged data, dealing yet another blow to the scandal-plagued pharmaceutical industry.



The State Drug Administration said inspectors found serious violations of a protocol for drug production involving the **Vero-cell** rabies vaccine at Changchun Changsheng Bio-technology, in Changchun, in the northern province of Jilin.

> **Vero cells** are a lineage of **cells** used in **cell** cultures. The '**Vero**' lineage was isolated from kidney epithelial **cells** extracted from an African green monkey.

In a statement on Sunday, the administration said it ordered its Jilin branch to revoke the company’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for medical products certificate, an essential licence for production.

> **Good manufacturing practices** (**GMP**) are the practices required in order to conform to the guidelines recommended by agencies that control the authorization and licensing of the manufacture and sale of food and beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, dietary supplements, and medical devices.

The statement said the batch involved in the inspection had not been put on the market, and inspectors from the Jilin drug regulator and the administration were stationed at the company for further investigation.

The administration did not give details of the forged data.
