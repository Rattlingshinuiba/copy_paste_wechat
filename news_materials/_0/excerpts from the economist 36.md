> NO ONE was going to mix up the envelopes atthis year’s Academy Awards. Each one had the category **embossed** in small block capitals in the middle, and in thick goldblock capitals in the top and bottom corners, so that the people at the back ofthe Dolby Theatre could have read them, as well as the presenters on the stage.After Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced that the winner for best picturewas “The Shape of Water”, the film’s director, Guillermo del Toro, jokinglydouble-checked that there hadn’t been a mistake, as there was last year when MrBeatty and Ms Dunaway gave the prize to “La La Land”, only to give it to“Moonlight” a minute later. One might think that Mr del Toro (pictured below)was purely joking. He had to like his chances, since “The Shape of Water” hadalready won Oscars for director, score and production design.

在今年的学院奖上，没人想把信封给搞错。每个人手中信封上写着获奖电影种类，信封中间印着浮雕图案的大写字母，顶端和低端一角也印着加粗的金色大写字母，这样除了人们在杜比剧院的后台就可以读到这些字，主持人在台上也可以读到它们。沃伦·比蒂和菲·唐娜薇宣布最佳影片得主是《水形物语》后，该影片的导演吉尔莫·德尔·托罗开玩笑地再次检查信封以确认错误没有发生。去年，比蒂和唐娜薇将最佳影片奖项颁给《爱乐之城》，一分钟后却又颁给了《月光男孩》时，这场乌龙就发生了。有人或许会想，德尔·托罗仅仅是开个玩笑，他觉得自己必胜无疑，因为《水形物语》已经斩获了最佳导演，最佳配乐和最佳艺术指导奖了。
