> # The Gun-Control Debate After Parkland



> Is this the moment when the politics of guns shifts? Since the fatal shooting of seventeen students and staff members last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, advocates of stricter gun laws have been asking that question, with *the wary hopefulness* of people who, **time and again**, have seen such turning points lead nowhere. This moment does feel different, though, largely because the teen-age survivors of the Parkland shooting have commanded the national stage with their raw and righteous indignation.



现在这种时刻下，枪支政治要出现转变吗？在上个月，佛罗里达州帕克兰的玛乔里·斯通曼·道格拉（Marjory Stoneman Douglas）高中发生了夺人性命的枪击事件，该事件之后，支持更为严格的枪支法律的人们就不停问及这个问题，人们一次又一次地看到过这类转机的出现，然而却无疾而终。不过，这次却让人感觉有所不同，大部分原因是帕克兰枪击案的年轻生还者在国家层面上有了一席之地，尽管他们强烈愤慨，义愤填膺。

 

> # The Economist explainsWhy driverless cars will mostly be shared, not ownedWHEN will you be able to buy a driverless car that will work anywhere? This commonly asked question contains three assumptions: that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will resemble cars; that people will buy them; and that they will be capable of working on all roads in all conditions. All three of those assumptions may be wrong. Although today’s experimental vehicles are modified versions of ordinary cars, with steering wheels that eerily turn by themselves, future AVs will have no steering wheel or pedals and will come in all sorts of shapes and sizes; pods capable of carrying six or eight people may prove to be the most efficient design. Rather than work everywhere, these pods will initially operate within geographically limited and well-mapped urban areas. And they will be shared “robotaxis”, summoned when needed using a ride-hailing app. The first self-driving vehicle you ride in will be shared, not owned, for a combination of technological and economic reasons.

你能够购买一辆无人驾驶汽车，它到哪都会运转正常，这种情况会在何时发生呢？这个稀疏平常的问题具有三点假设：自动驾驶载具与汽车类似；人们会去购买它们；它们在任何情况下任何马路上都能运转正常。而这三个假设或许全错了。如今的实验型载具是常见汽车的改良版本，其方向盘会自己打转，让人觉得诡异，然而未来的自动驾驶载具将没有方向盘或踏板，还会以各式各样的车形核颜色呈现在人们眼前；能装载6或8人的荚状车厢可能最终是最为有效的设计。这些车起初会在地理有限制，地图有序的城区运行，而不是在哪个地方都会运转。它们还能当作共享“自动驾驶计程车”，人们在需要它们时，能用一个叫车应用来召集它们。综合技术和经济因素，你坐上的第一辆自动驾驶载具会与他人共享，而不是当作所有物，
