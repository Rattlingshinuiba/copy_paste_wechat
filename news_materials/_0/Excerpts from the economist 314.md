> ACROSS the French countryside, in the summer of 1789, rumors swirled about vengeful aristocrats bent on the destruction of peasants’ property. It was not true. The Great Fear, as it is now known, tipped France into revolution with a flurry of fact-free gossip and rumor.

在1789年的夏天，有传言在法国各村里散播，说贵族们想要复仇，其势不可挡，要把农民的财产全部给毁了。当然这种说法子虚乌有。这起事件名为大恐慌（The Great Fear），以一阵缺乏事实的流言和谣言让法国陷入进了革命。

> Two centuries later the methods for spreading nonsense are much improved. In the first paper **of its kind**, published in *Science* on March 8th, Soroush Vosoughi and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology present evidence that, on Twitter at least, false stories travel faster and farther than true ones.



200年后，将胡扯的话给传开的路数可升级了不少。3月8号，麻省理工学院(MassachusettsInstitute of Technology)的苏鲁什·沃梭基（SoroushVosoughi）及其同事在《科学》（Science）上发表了第一份此类论文，给出证据表明至少在推特（Twitter）上，虚假故事传播地比真实故事还要快速和遥远。
