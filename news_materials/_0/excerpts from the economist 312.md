**Caution: In this translation, Dynamic equivalence, by Eugene Nida, is playing a major role.**

> GARDENERS know **only too well** how hard it is to keep on top of weeds, because **hoe**ing and pulling them out is back-breaking work. With big fields to look after, most farmers turn to herbicides. Over the years these chemicals have become better at knocking outweeds but leaving commercial crops alone. Organic farmers do not use artificial herbicides, and can suffer lower yields as a result. Which system produces the“better” crop **is open to** debate, although it is known that crops sprayed with herbicides are biochemically transformed **in subtle ways.** New work shows those changes in treated crops are**substantial enough to** change both their nutritional value and flavour.

园丁们太明白对付杂草有多难了，因为用锄头弄,再把它们拔出来会让你累成狗。大多数农民会有大面积区域要看管，于是就选择了除草剂。多年以来，这些除草剂得以改进，能除杂草，还保留住经济作物。而有机控的农民就是不用非天然除草剂，结果作物产量就减少了。哪一个会长出好庄稼还有待讨论，不过是个人都知道给农作物撒上除草剂就是在生化上对其进行微妙改造。有新结果表明，对农作物进行的那些改动足够到来影响它们的营养价值和口味了。
