> In 2015, there were 1.13 billion people living with high blood pressure worldwide, with the majority of them in low and middle-income countries.

2015年，世界上11.3亿人口伴有高血压，其中多数人居住在低收入和中等收入国家。

> The findings come from a new study published Tuesday in The Lancet, which found that the number of people affected by high blood pressure has almost doubled over the past 40 years.

此结果出自一项在《柳叶刀》发表的研究，研究发现，过去40年里，受高血压影响的人数几乎翻了一倍。

> In most countries, men were found to have higher blood pressure than women.

多数国家中，患高血压的男性其血压比女性要高。

> The study highlighted a stark contrast between where people are most affected, with high-income countries showing a sharp decline in blood pressure among their populations in recent decades, while low- and middle-income countries have seen numbers spike -- particularly in South Asia and Africa.

这项研究突出一个鲜明的对比：相比较下，受影响的人们中，高收入国家中大多数人血压近几十年来急剧下降，而低收入和中等收入国家中急剧上升——特别是在南亚和非洲。
