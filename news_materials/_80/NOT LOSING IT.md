"THE older the wiser” may ring true for much of life, but not for our ability to handle money. Studies suggest financial decision-making ability tends to reach its peak in a person’s mid-50s, after when deterioration sets in. “Age-friendly” banks are beginning to learn how to protect vulnerable older customers.

“姜还是老的辣”这句话对一生中很多时候都听起来不错，但是对掌管钱财的能力来说就另当别论了。研究表明，在财务上做出决定的能力在人的55岁趋于达到顶峰，在这之前人开始衰老。“年龄友好”型银行着手开始学习如何保护虚弱的年迈客户。

The most dramatic forms of age-related mental deterioration are neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s. But even “normal” ageing can cause cognitive change. Financial-management skills are often early casualties, because they demand both knowledge and judgment.

与年龄相关的心智衰退中，最有戏剧形式的就数像老年痴呆症这样的神经退化性疾病了。然而，甚至是“正常”的衰老也会引发认知上的变化。因为财务管理技能对知识和判断力都有要求，所以这些技能往往在早些时候就失去了。

Older people are more likely to struggle with day-to-day banking and are more susceptible to poor investment decisions. They are also more vulnerable to fraud or to financial exploitation, often by relatives.

老年人更可能疲于应付日常的银行业务，也更易因糟糕的投资决定而受到影响。老年人还在往往由亲属进行的诈骗或财务剥削面前显得不堪一击。
