## The Rohingya crisis

One month after the most concentrated cross-border movement of refugees in more than 20 years, the world still awaits a meaningful response. Unswayed by detailed accounts of ethnic cleansing by Myanmar’s army, India and China still back the country’s military rulers.

离20年间最集中的难民跨境行动已过去一个月了，整个世界仍在等待一个有意义的答复。印度和中国并未因缅甸军队种族清洗的详细报道而表现出动摇的样子，仍支持着缅甸军方统治者。

 South-East Asian nations are overwhelmingly in Myanmar’s corner, too. The West is too invested in Myanmar’s political and economic transition, and its imagined exit from China’s orbit, to take an overly principled position.

东南亚各个国家因缅甸困境而备受影响。西方世界过度投入缅甸政治和经济的过渡，想象着缅甸脱离中国的影响，以此占据一个有凭有据的地位。

This is the context in which the UN’s secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, will today brief the Security Council on the crisis. The UN’s arsenal includes travel bans and other potential sanctions against the generals.

在这些事件形成的背景上，联合国秘书长将会于今天向安理会说明这场危机的情况。联合国能拿得出手的手段包括有旅游禁令和其它针对缅甸将军们的可能性制裁。

Such measures are unlikely, unless China and Russia abstain. And what of the 500,000 recently displaced Rohingyas, and as many more that were already in Bangladesh? Myanmar has said they can return. The army, though, is unlikely to let them. And how many would want to?

除非中国和俄罗斯弃权投票，那么这些措施就不可能实行。那么50万最近流离失所的罗兴亚人该怎么办，更多已经在孟加拉国境内的罗兴亚人该怎么办？缅甸一方表示他们可以回来。然而军方不大可能允许罗兴亚人回来。毕竟，还会有多少罗星亚人还想回来呢？
