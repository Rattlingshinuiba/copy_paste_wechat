## How can human thinking be so powerful, yet so shallow?

As a result, people are individually rather limited thinkers and store little information in their own heads. Much knowledge，is instead spread through the community—whose members do not often realise that this is the case.

结果，从个体方面讲，人们进行颇为封闭的思考，在自己的脑子里储备一丁点的信息。大量知识在整个社区传播，而不是个人，这点往往还未被社区中的人员意识到。

The authors call this the illusion of understanding, and they demonstrate it with a simple experiment.

两位作家将这种现象称为理解型幻觉，并以一个简单实验来演绎这种现象。

 Subjects are asked to rate their understanding of something, then to write a detailed account of it, and finally to rate their understanding again. The self-assessments almost invariably drop.

实验对象被要求对某物的理解进行评级，之后对此物进行详尽描述，最后再次对该物的理解进行评级。这些自我评测的结果几乎无一例外地都呈下降状态。

The authors see this effect everywhere, from toilets and bicycles to complex policy issues. The illusion exists, they argue, because humans evolved as part of a hive mind, and are so intuitively adept at co-operation that the lines between minds become blurred.

两位作者从各处都观察到了这种结果，其涉及范围从厕所，自行车再到复杂政策问题。两位作者提出，此类幻觉是存在的，因为人类经进化成为类似“蜂窝”思维的一部分，自发对合作表现地颇为熟练，造成了人们各个思维之间的界限变得模糊。
