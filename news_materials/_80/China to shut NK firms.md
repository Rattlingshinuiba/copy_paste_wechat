## China to shut NK firms

China has long wanted to develop its inland regions and push industry to “go west”, in order to spread economic growth more evenly. Manufacturers have been loth to shift, in part because of the higher cost of moving goods to ports for export. Developing a rail-freight network to Europe—an important part of China’s “One Belt One Road” policy—opens up a new route to market for its poorest areas. The land route through Central Asia is relatively short. A container ship too large for the Suez canal must make a 24,000km journey to reach Europe. Trains travel no more than 11,000km to reach the same destination.

中国长期以来想要开发其内陆地区和推动工业向西发展，以此扩散经济发展，使其变得更加平衡。制造商不愿搬地方，部分原因有运输商品到港口以出口而产生的更高成本。开发一条通往欧洲的铁路运输网络——中国一带一路政策的一个重要组成部分——为最贫困地区的市场打造了一条新线路。贯穿中亚的这条陆上线路相对较短。一艘载有集装箱的船只对苏伊士运河来讲过于巨大，必须行进24000千米以达到欧洲。列车行进不到11000千米即可到达同样的目的地。

China said that all North Korean companies in the country would be shut. The commerce ministry set a 120-day deadline from the start of UN sanctions imposed after North Korea’s latest nuclear test. Separately, South Korea promised government support to companies hit by Chinese sanctions, imposed after it installed an American-made missile defence system that China says threatens its security.

中国称将要关闭国内所有朝鲜公司。商务部长定下了120天期限，时间从朝鲜最新核试验后联合国对其施加制裁时算起。另一方面，韩国对收到中国制裁冲击的朝鲜公司承诺会给予政府上的支持。在这些制裁之前，韩国部署美国反导系统，而中国称该系统威胁本国安全。
