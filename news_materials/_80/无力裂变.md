## 无力裂变

A ROGUE state has tested what may be a hydrogen bomb and has sent a missile over the territory of a neighbouring country. The American president has promised “fire and fury” if threats continue. The Security Council of the United Nations has been locked in debate. This sounds like the plot of a Hollywood thriller or a paperback potboiler in which the world is heading for conflagration.

一个无赖国家测试了某个装置，其可能是氢弹，还发射了一枚导弹，划过一个邻国领土的上空。美国总统承诺，假如威胁的脚步还不停歇，那么就会有“火与怒”。联合国安理会在辩论中陷入僵局。这听起来就像是一部好莱坞惊悚片的剧情简介，或者是一本粗制滥造的简装书，讲的是整个世界正面临着一片火海。

But international investors are not thrilled, and seem barely disconcerted, by the crisis on the Korean peninsula. Gold has risen a bit, the yield on Treasury bonds has dropped and the MSCI World equity index has fallen since the start of August. However, the moves have not been huge. Even the South Korean stockmarket, surely the most sensitive gauge of war risk, is well above its level at the start of the year.

尽管朝鲜半岛危机重重，但是国际上的投资者并没有为此而担惊受怕，看起来也几乎没有乱了阵脚。黄金小幅升值，美国国债收益下降，国际股票指数自8月起下降。然而，这些动作幅度并不大。甚至是韩国证券市场，也处于远高于年初的水平。人们认定韩国证券市场在战争风险方面上是最为敏感的测量仪器。

What explains this remarkable insouciance? One possibility is that the markets may simply not be very good at assessing political risk. After all, investors failed to foresee either the result of the Brexit referendum in Britain or the election of President Donald Trump.

市场表现出不在乎的样子，人们为此震惊，那么有什么能解释这种现象？有一种可能性就是市场仅仅不那么擅长评估政治风险。毕竟，投资者没能预见到脱欧公投的结果和川普当选美国总统。
