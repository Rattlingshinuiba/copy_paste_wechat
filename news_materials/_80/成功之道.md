WHAT makes a hit? Many assume it has to do with artistry or luck. Not so, says Derek Thompson, a writer and editor at the Atlantic. In his first book, “Hit Makers”, he analyses the psychology and economics of pop culture and argues that “hits”—the things that get everybody talking—are based on three rules that rely on more than creative genius alone.

是什么造就了热门产品？许多人觉得这与技艺和运气有关。在亚特兰大当记者和编辑的Derek Thompson称并非如此。他在处女作《热门制造者》一书中分析了流行文化的心理学和经济学因素，并且提出了人人谈论的热门产品基于三条准则，这三条准则远远不只依赖有创造力的天才。

First, consumers crave “familiar surprises”. Studies show that people opt for things they recognise over things they do not. Maybe there is an evolutionary explanation for this: survival taught humans that if they had seen an animal before, it had not killed them yet. This familiarity was comforting. The evidence for people’s response to recognition is everywhere: the Star Wars franchise, for example, is an amalgam of characters and themes from older films. But it remains a fine balance, as people enjoy thinking they have found something new—the “aha” moment, as Mr Thompson calls it.

首先，消费者渴望“倍感亲切的意料之外”。研究表明人们会选择他们已经认识的物品，而不去选择不认识的物品。或许有个进化论能够解释这一现象：如果人类以前到过某个动物，那么这个动物就还没杀掉他们。**（to me, this is synonymous with a dull explanation illustrated by a pandit I never ever pay little, of course, attention to . 对我来讲，这种解释就像是一个砖家在说天书，我绝对不会花半点时间去看。）**这种熟悉感让人有感到舒服。各处都能找到证据证明人们对于这种识别的回复：举个例子，星际大战系列是个从老旧影片中融合了角色和主题的产物。但是星战系列保持着不错的平衡，这是因为人们觉得他们找到了某种新东西，并从中获得乐趣，这种乐趣正如Derek Thompson所说，表现出来是“额里个娘哪”的惊叹之刻。
