## Freight gain 货运发展

ASTANA in Kazakhstan is one of the world’s most remote capitals, surrounded by thousands of kilometres of empty steppe. This summer Astana attempted to launch itself onto the global stage by hosting the World Expo, which closed on September 10th and underwhelmed many attendees. But there are other ways to have an impact. On the city’s north side, away from the Expo’s exhibits, a series of diesel trains, each pulling dozens of containers, roll through the old railway station. Most are heading from China to Europe. Last year over 500,000 tonnes of freight went by train between the two, up from next to nothing before 2013. Airlines and shipping firms are watching things closely.

位于哈萨克斯坦的阿斯塔纳是世界上地处最偏远的首都之一，为数千米空荡荡的大草原所环绕。今年夏天，阿斯塔纳举办了世博会，想以此尝试登上全球舞台，但是世博会于9月10日闭会，并未给参观者留下深刻印象。不过还是有其它门路来施加影响的。离开世博会展览地址，在城市的南方，一列一列的柴油火车以每列拉动几十个集装箱，驶过老旧的铁路站。其中大多数列车从中国出发，前往欧洲。去年，超过50吨的货物由火车运输往返于两地，而2013年之前几乎不存在货物运输。航空和航运公司正加以密切关注。

The trains rumbling through Astana result from a Chinese initiative, in tandem with countries like Kazakhstan, to build a “New Silk Road”through Central Asia. The earlier overland routes were once the conduits for most trade between Europe and China and India; they faded into irrelevance when European ships started circumnavigating the Cape of Good Hope.

中国的一项倡议造就了这些火车能驶过阿斯塔纳的场景，中国与像哈萨克斯坦这样的国家合作，旨在建立穿过中亚的新丝绸之路。这些早期的路上路线一度是欧洲，中国和印度间进行大多数贸易的渠道。欧洲船只开始环绕好望角时，这些路线逐渐无人问津。
