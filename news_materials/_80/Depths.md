Such self-destructive behavior demands explanation. Three reasons for it stand out.

这样一种自取灭亡的行为要有解释。三个原因尤为突出。

One is geography. The bulk of the ocean is beyond the horizon and below the waterline.

首先就是地理因素。海洋有一大部分在地平线之外并低于水位线。

The damage being done to its health is visible in a few liminal places—the Great Barrier Reef, say, or the oyster farms of Washington state.

在几个陆海交界的地方，比如大堡礁或位于华盛顿州的牡蛎养殖场，人们可以看到原先完整的大海正遭受破坏。

但是大体上讲，大海在人类视野之外，人类也不去关注大海。

It is telling that there is only a single fleeting reference to the ocean in the Paris agreement on climate change.

真实情况是:在气候变化问题上，巴黎协议中只对海洋有过一笔而过的短暂提及。

A second problem is governance. The ocean is subject to a patchwork of laws and agreements. Enforcement is hard and incentives are often misaligned.

第二个问题是治理因素。海洋受到东拼西凑的法律和协议的保护。执法困难，奖励措施没有落实到正确方面。
