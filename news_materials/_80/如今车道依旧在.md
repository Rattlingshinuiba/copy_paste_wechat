In Lima next Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee will rubber-stamp Paris as host of the 2024 Games. By the time the Games begin, Paris will be transformed.

国际奥委会将于下周三在授权巴黎成为2024年奥林匹克运动会主办方。巴黎将会在运动会到来之时得以蜕变。

 “Vehicles with combustion engines driven by private individuals” could well be banned from the city by then, says Jean-Louis Missika, the deputy mayor, whose responsibilities include urban planning. 

负责城市规划的巴黎副市长称“由个人驾驶的内燃机引擎交通工具”可能会到时候被禁止。

He gestures out of his office window in Paris’s city hall at the busy rue de Rivoli. By 2024, driverless shuttle buses should be going up and down the road all day. Olympic visitors will see a vision of the post-car city.

这位市长从坐落于巴黎市政厅的办公室窗户外对着繁忙的里沃利大街比划着。到2024年，无人驾驶穿梭公交会整天来路上来来回回。奥运会参观者将会看到一个对战后城市的未来畅想。

Anyone watching lorries calmly unload on pedestrian crossings in today’s Paris will struggle to believe this. Paris is now dirty, chaotic, years behind the transport frontrunners Amsterdam and Copenhagen and, according to its mayor, Anne Hidalgo, suffers 6,500 deaths a year from pollution. But that’s largely because Paris was built pre-car, and never had the space for the 20th-century technology. Now, as private cars start fading out, pre-car cities will come into their own. Paris, capital of the 19th century, could be the capital of the 21st.

在今日巴黎，卡车在人行道十字路上不慌不忙地卸货，任何人看到此番场景都难以相信这位市长的构想。巴黎如今又脏又乱，多年以来落后于交通方面上的领先者，每年又在污染方面上造成6500人死亡。但是这在很大程度上是因为巴黎的建立是在汽车出现之前，也从不为这项诞生于20世纪的技术留下空间。如今，随着私家车开始出现减少，这些建立于汽车诞生前的城市将会有发展的好势头。19世纪的首都巴黎，将会成为21世纪的首都巴黎。
