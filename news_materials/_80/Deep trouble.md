Fishing and aquaculture assurethe livelihoods of one in ten of the world’s people.

捕鱼和水产养殖确保了十分之一世界人口的生计。

Climate and weather systemsdepend on the temperature patterns of the ocean and its interactions with theatmosphere. If anything ought to be too big to fail, it is the ocean.

气候和天气系统依靠于大海的气温模式和大海与大气层的互动。如果要说某种事物应当大得不会出差错，那么这非海洋莫属了。

Humans have long assumed thatthe ocean’s size allowed them to put anything they wanted into it and to takeanything they wanted out.

人类长期以来认为海洋面积之大能让他们往海洋中放进自己想放进的，取出自己想取出的。

Changing temperatures andchemistry, overfishing and pollution have stressed its ecosystems for decades.

数十年来，温度和化学物质的改变，过度捕捞鱼类和污染问题对海洋生态系统造成了压力。

The ocean stores more thannine-tenths of the heat trapped on Earth by greenhouse-gas emissions.

温室气体排放会在地球积聚热量，海洋能够贮存逾十分之九该类热量。

塑料制品降解为细微片段，先经过鱼类再到人类的口中，这对人类健康有着无法确定的影响。

Appetite for fish growsnevertheless: almost 90% of stocks are fished either at or beyond theirsustainable limits (see Briefing). The ocean nurtures humanity. Humanity treatsit with contempt.

然而，人类对鱼的需求还在上涨：近90%的鱼类储备遭到捕捞，从可持续方面上看，这达到了或者超过了限度。海洋滋养人类。人类回以轻视。
