EVERY year about 120,000 organs, mostly kidneys, are transplanted from one human being to another.

每年都有约12万器官经一个人移植到另一个人身上，其中大多数器官为肾脏。

Sometimes the donor is a living volunteer.

有时候捐赠器官的人还活着就当上了志愿者。

Usually, though, he or she is the victim of an accident, stroke, heart attack or similar sudden event that has terminated the life of an otherwise healthy individual.

然而，通常情况下，捐赠者遭遇了事故，中风，心脏病或类似突发事件，这些事件剥夺了个体生命，而该个体除此之外一切健康。

 But a lack of suitable donors, particularly as cars get safer and first-aid becomes more effective, means the supply of such organs is limited.

在一些原因中，尤其因为汽车更安全和急救更加有效，所以缺乏适合的捐赠者意味着限制这些器官的提供。

Many people therefore die waiting for a transplant.

于是人们在等待器官移植的过程中逝去。

That has led researchers to study the question of how to build organs from scratch.

这就促使了研究者去研究一个问题，即如何从无到有地构造器官。

One promising approach is to print them.

一个方法具有前景，即复制器官。

Lots of things are made these days by three-dimensional printing, and there seems no reason why body parts should not be among them.

在近段时间，3D打印制造出了许多东西，因此没理由说为何人体部位不应该得到复制。

As yet, such “bioprinting” remains largely experimental.

目前为止，“生物打印”大部分还处于试验阶段。

But bio- printed tissue is already being sold for drug testing, and the first transplantable tissues are expected to be ready for use in a few years’ time.

但是经生物打印的组织已经拿去售卖以针对药品测试，而且过不了几年，首个移植组织有望做好准备而得到应用。
