An attempt by one of the world’s biggest carmakers to securelong-term supplies of **cobalt** for itspush into electric vehicles has been shunned by leading producers of the metal.

世界最大汽车制造商之一大众汽车试图获得钴金属的长期供应，以推动自身发展电动交通工具，然而遭到世界领先金属制造商的回绝。

Volkswagen issued a tender last month seeking a minimum of fiveyears of supply at a fixed price, according to people familiar with theprocess, but struggled to find any takers.

上月，据熟悉投标流程人士称，大众汽车发布投标以寻求以固定价格获得至少五年的钴供应，但是难以找到接受者。

The carmaker put off miners by suggesting a price that was wellbelow current market prices, which have jumped by more than 80 per cent thisyear, the people said.

据称，汽车制造商提供远低于当前市场价格的价位，这令矿商不满，而今年钴价格上涨了逾80%。

“They’re beingarrogant because they’re automotive and they’re used to doing it,” one trader said. “They completely misjudged the contents of the tender. There’s no pointnegotiating — it’s not even a discussion point.”

一家交易厂商称：“它们表现地自大，因为它们是做的是汽车这一行，并且习惯于做这类事，它们完全误判了这份投标的内容。谈判根本没有什么意义——甚至连讨论的地步都不到。”
