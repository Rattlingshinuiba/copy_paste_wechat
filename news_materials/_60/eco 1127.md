“ON AN AVERAGE morning a young urban professional anywhere in the world might wake up, check her social-media feed and order a cab on her mobile. 

在世界上任一处地方，一位住在城市的年轻教授可能会在一个普通的早晨中起床，

检查她社交媒体上的推送，并在手机上预约一辆出租车。

While sitting in traffic, she might use her phone to purchase groceries and watch a video, and later to pay the driver and buy a coffee. 

在车流中，她可能会用手机购物和看一段视频，之后给司机付钱再去买杯咖啡。

Once at work, she might make an online payment to reimburse a friend for a concert ticket.

一到了工作，她可能会因拿到一张朋友给的演唱会门票而进行线上支付去付还费用。

So far, so normal. But if that young urbanite were living in China, every one of these activities could have been powered either by Alibaba or a company in which it has a stake.

直到现在，这些事情都很正常。但是如果那位年轻的城市一员生活在中国，这一切行为可能是由阿里巴巴或者其持有股份的公司所推动的。

E-commerce in China is sweeping the board. 

在中国，相比较其他商务类型，电子商务大获全胜。

Last year online sales in China hit $366bn, almost as much as in America and Britain combined.

在去年，中国线上销售额达到3660亿美元，这几乎与美国和英国加起来的线上销售额一样多。
