A STRANGE-LOOKING SMALL roomfull of vintage furniture—an armchair, a chest of drawers, a table—was beingbuilt in the middle of **Infosys’s PaloAlto**offices when your correspondent visited in November.

通信记者在11月份来访时，可以看到一个外表怪异的小房间放满有复古的家具，其中有一架扶手椅，一箱抽屉还有一张桌子。在**Infosys’s Palo Alto**的各个办公室中，该房间建在中间位置。

**Tweed jackets** hung from a clothes rack; apiano was due to be delivered shortly. The structure was rough and unfinished.And that, according to Sanjay Rajagopalan, was largely the point.

粗花呢夹克衫挂在衣架上；一架钢琴预期不久后要被寄送出去。房屋结构简陋并且尚未完成装修。然而，Sanjay Rajagopalan说这些才是特别重要的东西。

Mr Rajagopalan is head ofresearch and design at the Indian business-services firm.He is **a disciple of** “design thinking”,a problem-solving methodology**rootedin** observation of successful innovators. His goal is an ambitious one:to turn a firm that built a global offshoring business by following clientspecifications into one that can set the terms of its projects for itself.

Rajagopalan来自印度商业服务公司，是该公司研究与设计部门的领导。他奉行着“设计性思维”，该思维是一种能解决问题的方法，且植根于对走向成功的创新者的观察。他的目标颇有雄心：将公司从按照客户说明去做全球离岸生意转变成能自己设定项目期限。
