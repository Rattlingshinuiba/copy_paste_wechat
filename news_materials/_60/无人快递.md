Irritating though they may eventually become to some, however, lightweight, slow-moving robots like Piaggio’s and Starship’s do not generate the safety concerns that accompany autonomous cars (which are heavy and fast-moving) and flying drones (which can fall out of the sky onto your head, and also cause a significant noise nuisance).

尽管它们可能最终会变得让人恼火，然而，例如Piaggio和 Starship公司，它们那轻便又慢速的机器人不会引起安全顾虑，而这类顾虑会伴随着出现在笨重又快速的自动驾驶汽车上，还会出现在能从天空落下砸中你的脑瓜，造成巨大噪声，令人心烦意乱的飞行无人机上。

As a result, they do not attract the same level of official regulation.

因此，它们不会与无人汽车和无人机处于相同水平而引起官方监管。

 Starship has successfully sponsored legislation in some American jurisdictions explicitly permitting autonomous delivery of the sort it is proposing to carry out.

美国有些管辖地区明确表示准许自动派送，Starship公司正准备进行这类派送，支持并成功实现在这方面上的立法。

It has found, though, that most cities welcome the robots with open arms.

不过，Starship公司也发现大部分城市对这些机器人表示欣然接受。

They have the potential to reduce pollution and congestion by taking vans off the roads, to increase convenience and to reduce costs.

这些机器人能将货车不再出现在公路上，因此有可能减少污染，减缓拥堵，增进便利和减少成本。

And they have one other advantage. When they do bring something to your doorstep, they do not expect a tip.

它们还有另一个优势，即它们把东西送到你家门口时，不会期待能索要个小费。
