它们收集你的数据以让算法确定什么会吸引你的注意，用“注意力经济”去让用户往下翻动，点击，分享——如此反复。

Anyone setting out to shape opinion can produce dozens of ads, analyze them and see which is hardest to resist.

着手形成观点的人能够产生几十个广告，去分析广告并且去观察出哪个广告最难以拒绝。

The result is compelling: one study found that users in rich countries touch their phones 2,600 times a day.”

结果令人服气：一项研究发现富有国家用户每天点击手机屏幕2600次。
