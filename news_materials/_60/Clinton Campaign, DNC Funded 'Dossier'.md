*Dossier*was among our top lookups (an increase of approximately 7600% more than its average rate) on October 25th, 2017, following reports in a number of news sources on the connections between Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and the compiler of a dossier on Donald Trump.

希拉里·克林顿竞选活动，民主党全国委员会以及编纂唐纳徳·川普档案人员之间的联系由一些新闻源所报道，之后便引起了*Dossier*一词在25日升至单词查询榜首。

The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund research that resulted in a now-famous dossier containing allegations about President Trump’s connections to Russia and possible coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin, people familiar with the matter said.

克林顿竞选活动与民主党全国委员会推动了基金调查行动，该行动结果发现一份如今众人皆知的卷宗，其内容包括对以下行为的指控：特朗普通俄以及竞选活动与克里姆林宫可能存在合作行动。人们对此倍感亲切：“还是原来的配方，还是熟悉的味道。”
