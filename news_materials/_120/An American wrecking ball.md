## An American wrecking ball

IF AMERICA is the biggest loser from the election of Donald Trump, can Asia not claim at least second place? Many policymakers and Asia hands argue so. In just seven months Mr Trump has swung “a wrecking-ball into the complex and long-standing machinery” of America's relations with the Asia-Pacific region, writes T.J. Pempel of the University of California, Berkeley. Such a view is widely shared across Asia: that American leadership, which has underpinned the regional order since the second world war, is in peril under Mr Trump.

如果说特朗普当选总统使美国成最大输家，那么亚洲怎能不宣称其是第二输家？很多政策制定者与亚洲国家认为就是如此。来自加州大学伯利克分校的TJ Pempel写到，川普仅仅用7个月就“向复杂又存在已久的体制挥动起落锤”，破坏了美国与亚太地区间的关系。如此观点颇受亚洲一方的广泛认同，认为美国从二战后充当领导角色支撑起的地区秩序，其领导地位在川普的影响下处于危险状态。

The list of concerns is long. Not only is the American president unpredictable. He lacks intellectual engagement in foreign policy and disdains diplomacy itself, except when it is conducted via bombastic tweets. He has ended America's commitment to multilateral trade in Asia, pulling it out of negotiations for a 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade grouping encompassing two-fifths of world trade. Economists say this deal would have made all parties richer; Mr Trump dismissed it as “an attack on American business”. He was also quick to accuse old allies such as Japan and South Korea of unfair trade practices as well as of freeriding on American security guarantees.

忧虑的内容可是方方面面，并不仅仅只是有美国那令人无法预测未来行动的总统。川普在参与外交政策时缺乏智慧，并且蔑视外交本身，当然他通过那充满大话的推特来进行外交是个例外。川普终结了美国参与在亚洲的多边贸易，让美国退出了针对跨太平洋12国伙伴关系的协商会议，此伙伴关系涉及到的是一个涵盖世界五分之二贸易量的组织。经济学家认为此协议原本会使各方都更加富有，但川普认为其是针对美国贸易的一场攻击而不予理会。川普还快速行动，指责包括日本和韩国在内的老伙计联盟存在不公平贸易行为，还指责了他们借助美国的安全保障而没给予回报。
