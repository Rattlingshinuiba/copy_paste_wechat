After 2 1/2 years of war, little is functioning in Yemen.

两年半的战争过后，也门的情况鲜有改善。

Repeated bombings have crippled bridges, hospitals and factories. Many doctors and civil servants have gone unpaid for more than a year. Malnutrition and poor sanitation have made the Middle Eastern country vulnerable to diseases that most of the world has confined to the history books.

不间断的爆炸摧毁了桥梁，医院和工厂。大量医生和公务员超过一年没有得到工资。营养不良和卫生条件差使中东国家变得不堪一击，无法应对疾病，而所说的这些疾病由世界上大多数国家给限制到只在历史书上出现。

In just three months, cholera has killed nearly 2,000 people and infected more than half a million, one of the world’s largest outbreaks in the past 50 years.

仅仅三个月，疟疾就剥夺了将近2000人的性命，并且超过50万人受到感染，这是世界上过去50年中最严重的疾病暴发事件之一。

“It’s a slow death,” said Yakoub al-Jayefi, a Yemeni soldier who has not collected a salary in eight months, and whose 6-year-old daughter, Shaima, was being treated for malnutrition at a clinic in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa.

“死亡的过程很煎熬。”一名也门士兵说。这位士兵已8个月没有领到薪水，他的6岁女儿正在也门首都一诊所接受营养不良的治疗。

Since the family’s savings ran out, they had lived mostly off milk and yogurt from neighbors. But that wasn’t enough to keep his daughter healthy, and her skin went pale as she grew thin.

家里的积蓄用光，他们就依靠牛奶和从邻居那得来的酸奶。然而这还不足以保持女儿的健康，她的皮肤随着她长大而变得苍白。

Like more than half of Yemenis, the family did not have immediate access to a working medical center, so Jayefi borrowed money from friends and relatives to take his daughter to the capital.

想超过一半的也门人一样，此家庭不能直接进入医疗中心，尽管医疗中心还在工作，因此一家人从朋友和亲戚那借钱以让女儿去首都。
