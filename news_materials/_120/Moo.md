The most advanced practitioner of the still-experimental art of growing leather is Modern Meadow, an American firm. This month it moved from Brooklyn, New York, where its 60 staff have been quietly developing the new material, to a laboratory in Nutley, New Jersey, where they will begin production trials. Modern Meadow, which has raised more than $50m from investors and is collaborating with a number of as-yet-unnamed other firms in the clothing, shoe, furniture and automotive industries, hopes to bring the new material to market within two years.

一家名为现代草地的美国公司走在世界前沿，从事尚处于试验阶段的皮革制作工作。此公司原址位于纽约市的布鲁克林区，在那里公司60名员工低调研发新材料。公司于本月搬到了新泽西州的纽特利市中一实验室，在那里他们将开始产品试验。现代草地公司已从投资方筹资超过5000万美元，正与一些未经披露的其他公司达成合作，这些公司涉及有服装，鞋，家具和汽车行业。现代草地公司期望在两年内将新材料上市。

Factory-grown leather promises several advantages over skins taken from animals. One is that it can be made in convenient sheets with straight edges, rather than being constrained by the irregular shapes that animals come in. Another is that it is more consistent than the natural stuff. It is devoid of the scars, marks and other defects to which real skin is inevitably prone. Nor does it vary from animal to animal in the way that natural leather does.

皮革由工厂制造，相比由剥动物皮而获得，其有几个优势。优势之一就是制作的皮革形状是方便操作的片状，边缘挺直，而不是通过动物皮而压缩成不规则形状。另一优势是这种皮革比天然皮革更具有均一性。这种皮革没有疤痕，标记和其它缺陷，而动物真皮上不可避免地倾向具有这些缺陷。天然皮革在动物与动物间也有所不同，工厂制作的这种皮革不会出现这种情况。
