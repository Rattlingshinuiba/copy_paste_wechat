## Donald Trump has no grasp of what it means to be president

> This is a dangerous moment. America is cleft in two. After threatening nuclear war with North Korea, musing about invading Venezuela and equivocating over Charlottesville, Mr Trump still has the support of four-fifths of Republican voters. Such popularity makes it all the harder for the country to unite.

现在是危急时刻。美国一分为二。川普就算扬言与朝鲜开战，考虑入侵委内瑞拉，对待夏洛茨维尔的态度模棱两可，他仍有五分之四共和党选民的支持。他的如此之受欢迎会使整个国家难以团结起来。

> This leads to the question of how Republicans in public life should treat Mr Trump. Those in the administration face a hard choice. Some will feel tempted to resign. But his advisers, particularly the three generals sitting at the top of the Pentagon, the National Security Council and as Mr Trump’s chief of staff, are better placed than anyone to curb the worst instincts of their commander-in-chief.

这就引发了这样一个问题：共和党该如何在公共场合下对待川普。管理层的那些人面对一个艰难抉择。这些人中有一部分觉得想去辞职。然而川普的顾问们——尤其是在五角大楼，国家安全委员这些机构的三位高层领导以及川普的总参谋长——相比其他任何人去控制住他们“总长官”的糟糕本性，这三位高管会做地更好。

> For Republicans in Congress the choice should be clearer. Many held their noses and backed Mr Trump because they thought he would advance their agenda. That deal has not paid off. Mr Trump is not a Republican, but the solo star of his own drama. By tying their fate to his, they are harming their country and their party. His boorish attempts at plain speaking serve only to poison national life. Any gains from economic reform—and the booming stockmarket and low unemployment owe more to the global economy, tech firms and dollar weakness than to him—will come at an unacceptable price.

对国会中的共和党来讲这种选择应该会更显而易见。他们中许多人捏住鼻子，支持川普，其原因是这些人认为川普会将他们的议程提前。这个交易到现在还没。川普不是共和党人，而是唱独角戏的人。这些人把其命运和川普的命运相关联，那么就会对其国家和党派有害。川普鲁莽尝试简洁措辞只会毒害国家前程。繁荣股市和低失业率，这些都更归功于全球经济，科技公司和美元疲软，而不是川普的功劳。经济改革带来的任何后果将会以惊人代价来临。

> Republicans can curb Mr Trump if they choose to. Rather than indulging his outrages in the hope that something good will come of it, they must condemn them. The best of them did so this week. Others should follow.

如果共和党愿意，他们能控制住川普。他们纵容川普爱发火的行为以希望某些好结果会从中产生，这是不应当的。他们必须谴责川普的那种行为。共和党中有卓越之士就在本周如此做了。其他人应该以此效仿。
