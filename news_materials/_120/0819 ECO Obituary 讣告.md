[梦雨的ENG外刊乱炖](javascript:void(0);) *2017-08-23*

> TO HER friends, it seemed as if Heather Heyer was always sounding off about something. Why was the world so unfair? Why did one particular kid get bullied on the school bus? Why could her gay friends not get married? Why did Alfred Wilson, her lovely division manager at Miller Law, who was college-educated and hipster-elegant, get followed when he went to the store, just because he was black? Why did some friends have such bad luck that they had to crash with her for months because they had nowhere to go? She was happy to let them. But she wondered, and she complained. If you’re not outraged, she posted, you’re not paying attention.

对她的朋友来讲，似乎希瑟海耶一直为一些事打抱不平。为何世界如此不公？为何一个小孩子会在校车上被欺凌？为何她所认识的同性恋朋友们不能结婚？为何她那在米勒律师事务所当部门经理且讨人喜欢的阿尔弗雷德威尔逊会在进商店时遭人跟踪，仅仅是因为他是黑人？为何她的一些朋友如此不幸而不得不借宿于她家整整几月只因为他们无处可依？希瑟海耶很乐意接纳他们。但她也为此琢磨，并且为此而抱怨。她发帖说，你没感到愤怒，只是你还未发觉。

> She shed tears about it, too. A Facebook post or a news item would set her off at the computer, even at work. She cried about cruelty and unfairness and racist insults, and posted a link to a video entitled: “If You’re Scared of Islam, Meet a Muslim”. She was so upset about a policeman in Fort Worth, Texas, dragging a black woman along the ground, that she called for him to be fired. The election of Donald Trump was the worst; it made her desperate about her country. She had posted Bernie Sanders’s picture on her Facebook page, hoping.

她也为此哭泣过，脸书上的一个帖子或一则新闻会使她即使在工作也时也会在电脑前抽泣。她大声指责暴行，不公和种族攻击，张贴链接于一视频，标题是：“如果你惧怕Islam，那么就见一见他们吧。（或许你就会改变想法）”在德州沃斯堡，一名警察在路上拖拉一名黑人女星，她为此很难受，并呼吁这名警察受到革职。川普对她来讲当选总统是最糟糕的事件，这让她对美国很失望，她在脸书主页上发帖子，上面有伯尼桑德斯的照相，对未来仍有期待。
