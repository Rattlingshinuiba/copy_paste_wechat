## 英国王室的分水岭

It is tragic, of course, that it took a grotesque accident to force the royal household to adapt to social changes others had embraced years before. And for a few days, the House of Windsor looked dithery and uncertain. The audible silence allowed imbecilic “experts” to demand the royal ensign be flown at half-mast over Buckingham Palace. It cannot be, for the simple reason that the country is never without a monarch — hence: “The king is dead. Long Live the King.”

想要迫使皇室适应他人早已于多年前接受的社会潮流，就得发生一件荒诞之事，这真是场悲剧。几天下来，温莎王朝看起来犹豫不决。明显的沉默让某些砖家有机可乘，要求皇室在白金汉宫降半旗。这种想法不会实现，原因很简单，这个国家一直拥有君主，于是就有这一句话：国王已死，永世长存。

Instead, the monarchy emerged sadder and wiser from Diana’s death. It remains the grandest European royal house, and it will be years — if it ever happens at all — before it becomes one of the “bicycling monarchies”. Change comes slowly to the House of Windsor. But that is perhaps one of the secrets of its longevity.

黛安娜死后，王室变得悲伤同时也更加明智。它仍是欧洲皇室中最大的一个，并且将持续多年下去，除非它变成了自行车上的王室。温莎王朝变化缓慢。不过这或许是它长存的秘密之一。

Of course Britain is not the country it was in 1997. Diana’s end came as a terrible shock for everyone. It took the death of a privileged young woman to free those who might one day have been her people.

英国已经不是1997的那样了。黛安娜的死亡对当时的人来说十分可怕震惊。一名特权之下的年轻女性的死亡，换来了本能成为她子民的自由。
