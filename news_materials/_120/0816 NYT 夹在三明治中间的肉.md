>  India’s main garrison in the Kingdom of Bhutan sits only 13 miles from a disputed border with China. There is a training academy, a military hospital, a golf course — all testament to India’s enduring role defending this tiny Himalayan nation.

不丹王国的印度边防军驻守在离与中国有边界争议的地方仅13英里。驻守之地有军校，部队医院和高尔夫球场，这一切都见证了印度长期以来扮演守卫弹丸大小的喜马拉雅之国的角色。

> Earlier this summer, China began extending an unpaved road in the disputed territory, and India sent troops and equipment to block the work. The incursion has resulted in a tense standoff that has lasted more than 50 days, with Indian soldiers facing Chinese troops who have dug in just a few hundred yards away.

立夏之际，在这个争议之地，中国开始修建一条还未铺建的公路，印度便派军并使用装备，令修路进度停止。印度的插入引发了一场持续了50多天的严峻对峙，其士兵对中国军队相对，而中国军队才刚修了几百码开外。

> At a time when North Korea and the United States are trading threats of war, China and India — the world’s two most populous nations — have engaged in increasingly bellicose exchanges over this remote border dispute.

正当朝鲜与美国互相扬言战争之时，中国和印度——世界上人口最多的两个国家——在遥远的分歧边界中陷入不断上升的冲突气焰。

> There are fears that ambition and nationalism could lead them to war.

人们就担心野心和民族主义会引发两者间的冲突。

> Caught between these two nuclear rivals seeking regional dominance is Bhutan, a mountain nation of 800,000 with a mystical reputation and a former king who popularized the concept of “gross national happiness” as a measure of a country’s well-being.

在这两个核武对抗国寻求地区主权时，两者之间还有拥有80万人口的山地之国不丹，其对外神秘，前国王还使一个概念为人们所熟知：国民幸福总值，用来衡量一个国家的繁荣。

> India says it is acting on Bhutan’s behalf in the standoff. But its intervention has not resulted in much gratitude here. On the contrary, many in Bhutan feel that India’s protective embrace has become suffocating.

印度称与中国进行对峙是为了不丹而着想。然而印度的介入并未在不丹获得很多感激。恰恰相反，不丹很多人觉得印度保护性支持让人喘不过气来。

> “In the case of war between India and China, we would be the meat in the sandwich,” said Pema Gyamtsho, a leader of the opposition party in Bhutan’s National Assembly. “It shouldn’t have to be a choice,” he added.

“我们就像三明治中间的肉一样，”不丹国民大会的反对党领导Pema Gyamtsho如是说。“这不该是站哪边的问题。”他补充道。

> Chinese fascination with Bhutan bloomed after one of Hong Kong’s biggest movie stars, Tony Leung, married the actress Carina Lau here in 2008. The wedding three years later of the current king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, also stoked interest after footage of it went viral in China.

香港影星梁朝伟和女演员刘嘉玲在不丹于2008年结婚后激起了中国人对不丹的向往。三年后现任国王的婚礼的片段也在中国流行一时，引起人们的兴趣。

> Pema Tashi, who manages Happiness Kingdom Travel and advertises “a sojourn in paradise,” caters to Chinese clients with eight guides who speak Mandarin. He complained that there were no direct flights between Bhutan and China, and expressed suspicion that India had worked to prevent a normalization of relations that would open up such routes.

幸福王国旅行社的Pema Tashi是社里的经理，他还宣传“暂歇天堂”的项目，招待中国客户，安排8名会说普通话的导游。这位经理抱怨称不丹和中国间没有直达航班，并怀疑印度阻止了不丹与中国的正常关系，而这正会打开双边的航班。
