## More skin in the game

> LEATHERMAKING is an ancient craft. The oldest leather artefact found so far is a 5,500-year-old shoe from a cave in Armenia, but paintings in Egyptian tombs show that, 7,000 years ago, leather was being turned into all manner of things, from sandals to buckets to military equipment. It is a fair bet that the use of animal skins for shelter and clothing goes back hundreds of thousands of years at least.

皮革制作是一门古老的工艺。目前为止发现的最古老的皮革工艺制品出土于亚美尼亚一洞穴内，然而位于埃及古墓的画作又表明皮革于七千年前就由人们制作成各种各样的东西，其包括凉鞋，桶和军事装备。动物皮用作屋檐和服装的历史能追溯到起码十万年前，这种说法令人信服。

> Leathermaking is also, though, a nasty business. In 18th-century London the soaking of putrefying hides in urine and lime, to loosen any remaining flesh and hair, and the subsequent pounding of dog faeces into those skins to soften and preserve them, caused such a stench that the business was outlawed from the City proper and forced downwind and across the river into Bermondsey.In countries such as India and Japan, the trade tainted people as well as places and was (and often still remains) the preserve of social outcasts such as Dalits and Burakumin.

尽管如此，皮革制作还是个肮脏活。在十八世纪伦敦，通过浸泡使东西腐败其秘诀在于使用尿和石灰，其目的是松散内质和分散头发，接着用狗的粪便拍打，使之进入动物皮，让动物皮能软化并储藏下来，以上这些步骤中会发出恶臭，因此在城市本部，顺风处和流入伯蒙德赛的河两岸，皮革业被列为非法行为，在像印度和日本这样的国家内，皮革业不仅使人败坏声誉，还使地方污浊不堪，但是这属于印度达利特人和日本部落民这些受社会唾弃者的专属领域。
