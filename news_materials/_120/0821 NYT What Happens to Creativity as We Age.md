> One day not long ago, Augie, a 4-year-old Gopnik grandchild, heard his grandfather wistfully say, “I wish I could be a kid again.” After a thoughtful pause, Augie came up with a suggestion: Grandpa should try not eating any vegetables. The logic was ingenious: Eating vegetables turns children into big strong adults, so not eating vegetables should reverse the process.

不久前一天，一名叫Augie Gopnik的4岁小孙子听着他爷爷带着伤感的语气说:“我真希望我再变成小孩。”Augie 先琢磨了一会，之后便提出一个点子：爷爷应尝试不再吃任何一类蔬菜。这其中的逻辑具有独创性：吃蔬菜能让小孩变成强壮的大人，因此不吃蔬菜就会逆转这样的过程。

> No grown-up would ever come up with that idea. But anyone with a 4-year-old can tell similar stories. Young children’s creativity seems to outstrip that of even the most imaginative adults.

没有大人会有那种主意。不过和四岁小孩相似的那类人能够说出这种相似的故事。年轻的孩子其创造力似乎能比最具有想象力的成年人还要高。

How does the ability to come up with unusual ideas change as we grow older? Does it begin to flag in adolescence? Before then? To investigate these questions, we and our colleagues recently conducted several experiments, which we relate in a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

> 随着我们长大，这种能想出不同寻常的主意的能力是如何消逝的呢？此能力是在青春期就开始削减的吗？此能力是在什么时间之前发生的？我们与同事近日进行了几个实验，将这些实验与在《美国国家科学院院刊》发表的一篇新论文相联系以弄清这些问题。
