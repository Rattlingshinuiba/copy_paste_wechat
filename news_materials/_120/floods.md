## floods

梦雨 [梦雨的ENG外刊乱炖](javascript:void(0);) *2017-09-01*

THE extent of the devastation will become clear only when the floodwater recedes, leaving ruined cars, filthy mud-choked houses and the bloated corpses of the drowned. But as we went to press, with the rain pounding South Texas for the sixth day, Hurricane Harvey had already set records as America's most severe deluge (see Briefing). In Houston it drenched Harris County in over 4.5trn litres of water in just 100 hours—enough rainfall to cover an eight-year-old child.

只有当洪水褪去之后，人们才能清楚看到其破坏规模：汽车损毁，脏兮兮，沾满泥土的房屋和淹死遇难，呈巨人观状的尸体。但是本报社发行本期之际，正是大雨袭击德州南部的第六天，哈维飓风导致了洪水，破了美国最严重洪水灾害记录。在休斯顿，哈维飓风淹没了哈里斯县，仅仅100小时就降雨量超过4.5万亿升，这足以淹没至8岁小孩的身高。

The fate of America's fourth-largest city holds the world's attention, but it is hardly alone. In India, Bangladesh and Nepal, at least 1,200 people have died and millions have been left homeless by this year's monsoon floods. Last month torrential rains caused a mudslide in Sierra Leone that killed over 1,000 —though the exact toll will never be known. Around the world, governments are grappling with the threat from floods. This will ultimately be about dealing with climate change. Just as important, is correcting short-sighted government policy and the perverse incentives that make flooding worse.

这座美国第四大城市所遭遇的厄运让引起了全世界的注意，不过肯定不是只有这一座城市遭殃。在印度，孟加拉国和尼泊尔，今年这些雨季带来的洪水使得至少1200人遇难，上百万人无家可归。在塞拉利昂，上个月的暴雨导致一场泥石流，1000多人死亡，不过确切死亡数目将永远无法确定。在整个世界里，政府正努力解决洪水带来的威胁。最终这将与气候变化有关。同样重要的是，政府政策的目光短浅，充斥各处的加重洪水的因素，这些需要得到纠正。
