> DEFENDERS of President Donald Trump offer two arguments in his favour—that he is a businessman who will curb the excesses of the state; and that he will help America stand tall again by demolishing the politically correct taboos of left-leaning, establishment elites. From the start, these arguments looked like wishful thinking. After Mr Trump’s press conference in New York on August 15th they lie in ruins.

川普的维护者提出两点有利于川普的观点，其一是川普作为商人可以控制住盈余，另一点是川普会清除掉左倾的当权精英的政治正确禁忌，使美国再次伟大。从一开始这些观点就看起来是一厢情愿。在8月15号，纽约，川普的新闻发布会过后，这些论点完全站不脚了。



> The unscripted remarks were his third attempt to deal with violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. In them the president stepped back from Monday’s—scripted—condemnation of the white supremacists who had marched to protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, a Confederate general, and fought with counter-demonstrators, including some from the left. In New York, as his new chief of staff looked on dejected, Mr Trump let rip, stressing once again that there was blame “on both sides”. He left no doubt which of those sides lies closer to his heart.

在周末川普第三次欲解决发生在弗吉利亚州的夏洛茨维尔的暴力冲突，川普在此即兴演讲。这次演讲中，川普以旁观者的角度来看待周一那份有底稿的针对白人至上主义者的谴责，这些人前去抗议拆除南部邦联将军罗伯特李雕像的行为，这些人还和部分来自左派的反对示威者斗争（美国版 demolishment of four out-of-date sources ）。在纽约，川普的新总参谋长看着沮丧时，川普表现得言辞激烈，再次强调“两边”都该受到谴责。哪边与川普的立场站地更近，川普对此表示的很明确。

> Mr Trump is not a white supremacist. He repeated his criticism of neo-Nazis and spoke out against the murder of Heather Heyer .Even so, his unsteady response contains a terrible message for Americans. Far from being the saviour of the Republic, their president is politically inept, morally barren and temperamentally unfit for office.

川普并不是一名白人至上主义者。他反复批评新纳粹主义，公开谴责对希瑟海耶的杀害。尽管这样，他不坚定的回应中包含了对美国人来讲很可怕的讯息。美国人的这位总统在办公上不适合参政，毫无道德和性情不稳，远不及能成为拯救共和党的人。
