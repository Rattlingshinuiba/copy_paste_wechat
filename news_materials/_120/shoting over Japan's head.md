## shoting over Japan's head

WHEN the alarm sounded from loudspeakers in the streets and his mobile telephone around 6am on August 29th, Saburo Ito thought it was a warning about an earthquake. But when he read that a North Korean missile was passing overhead the 72-year-old taxi driver panicked and ran out into the garden. The instruction to “evacuate to a sturdy building or basement” was all but forgotten. “I had no idea what to do or where to go,” he says.

8月29日早上约六点，大街上的扩音器拉响警报，saburo还以为这是个地震警报。但是当他发觉一枚朝鲜导弹划过头顶，这名72岁的出租车司机慌忙出去逃进花园。“请撤离至坚固建筑或地下室。”这种指示早已几乎被抛向脑后，他称：“我不知道该怎么做，该去哪里。”

Japanese have been oddly sanguine about military threats, even as China has grown more powerful and North Korea has tested ever more capable missiles and atom bombs. Japanese refer to this state of mind as heiwaboke, meaning roughly to take peace and security for granted.

中国强大了起来，朝鲜了测试越来越多的可装载式导弹和原子弹，日本对此却异常地乐观。日本将此称为一种心态：heiwaboke,大致指将和平与安全视为理所当然之事。



It was not the first time that North Korea had fired over Japan; it had conducted similar tests four times previously (under the guise of satellite launches). But the latest shot was a surprise, not least because recent tensions over North Korea's testing of long-range missiles had appeared to ease of late. America has grown increasingly alarmed that its bases in Guam, or perhaps America's western seaboard, could soon be threatened by the regime of Kim Jong Un. Japan has long lived under the shadow of his rockets. What is more alarming is the consensus among analysts that his engineers have probably mastered the technology of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a missile.

朝鲜使导弹飞越日本，这种事情发生已不是第一次了。此前朝鲜以发射卫星做掩饰，进行了四次类似的测试。但是最近的这次发射让人震惊，不仅仅因为在朝鲜测试远程导弹的问题上，目前紧张局势看似得以缓和。美国对此变得更加警觉，担心金正恩政权很快会威胁到关岛基地和西海岸。日本长期以来处于金正恩的玩具造成的阴影之下。更让人觉得恐慌的是，分析师们一致认为：金正恩手下的工程师很可能掌握了能使核弹头足以装在导弹上的技术。
