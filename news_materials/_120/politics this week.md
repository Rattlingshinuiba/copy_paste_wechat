> The remaining suspects of a jihadist cell that attacked Barcelona appeared in court. The attackers used a van to plough into people out for a stroll in the city's Las Ramblas boulevard; hours later, another vehicle hit pedestrians in the nearby town of Cambrils.

Six assailants were killed by police; it is thought the terrorists had been planning a much bigger attack involving bombs, perhaps against the Sagrada Família basilica in Barcelona. See article.

俄罗斯一所剧院经理Kirill Serebrennikov遭到软禁，受指控称其挪用政府基金。在入夏不久，他基于鲁道夫纽瑞耶夫生平而创作的芭蕾舞被取消在莫斯科大剧院首映，其原因很可能是此剧凸显了舞蹈演员的同性取向。
