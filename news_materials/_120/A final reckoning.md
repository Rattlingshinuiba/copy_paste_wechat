## A final reckoning

North Korea’s latest nuclear test has caused alarm and condemnation not just in Washington and Seoul — but also in Tokyo, Beijing and Moscow. The new device tested by Pyongyang is its most powerful yet. The North Koreans’ claim that it is a hydrogen bomb could be accurate. This test also comes just a week after the Kim Jong Un regime fired a ballistic missile over Japan. The escalations and provocations from Pyongyang are now coming thick and fast.

朝鲜最近的核试验引发的恐慌和谴责之声不只来自于美国和韩国，还来自于日本，中国和俄罗斯。朝鲜此次测试的装置可以说是迄今为止最具有威力的了。朝鲜宣称此装置为氢弹，这种说法看来没有偏差了。离金正恩政权发射穿越日本的弹道导弹事件仅仅过去一周，一波未平，此次测试就一波又起。事态正在快速升级，来自朝鲜的挑衅日趋胆大。

But shared global anxiety is still unlikely to lead to a truly unified international approach. On the contrary, it may even widen divisions between the Americans, who want to increase the coercive pressure on Pyongyang, and the Chinese and South Koreans who favour talks with North Korea.

但是各国普遍焦虑，仍不大可能促进一个真正的国际团结态度。与此相反，美国与中国，韩国之间可能会因此扩大分歧。美国想针对朝鲜加强高压政策，而中国和韩国更倾向于和朝鲜谈判。

Yet while the major international actors remain frustrated and impotent, the North Korean threat continues to mount. After years of rumbling away in the background, North Korea has pushed its way to the very front of the international agenda. Some sort of final crisis may now be in the offing. But even the main actors in this drama cannot yet know whether that crisis will lead to negotiations or war.

不过主要大国处于困境和无能时，朝鲜的威胁仍在持续上升。朝鲜低调地闷声发大炮了许多年后，将自己推到了国际议程表的最首项。某种最终危机可能正处于酝酿状态。但是就算这出戏的主要大国也不知这场危机会不会促成会谈或者造成战争。
