这篇昨天发布的经济学人的科技板块文章主标题是 早起的鸟，意指那句熟悉的谚语。副标题是 the world's first quantum-cryptographic satellite network is likely to be China. 世界首个量子加密卫星网络国家很可能是中国。



IN THE never-ending arms race between encryptors and eavesdroppers, many of those on the side that is trying to keep messages secret are betting on quantum mechanics, a description of how subatomic particles behave, to come to their aid. In particular, they think a phenomenon called quantum entanglement may provide an unsubvertable way of determining whether or not a message has been intercepted by a third party. Such interception, quantum theory suggests, will necessarily alter the intercepted message in a recognisable way, meaning that the receiver will know it is insecure. This phenomenon depends on the fact, surprising but true, that particles with identical properties which are created simultaneously are entangled in a way that means one cannot have its properties altered without also altering the other, no matter how far apart they are.

在加密者与窃听者这场永无止境的军备竞赛中，秘密行动的一方中有许多人力图保密信息，并寄希望于量子力学上作为辅助。量子力学描述了次原子粒子运动的方式。特别的是，这些人认为一种叫量子缠结的现场可能会提供一个没有损失的方法，让他们确认某一信息是否被第三方截留。量子理论认为这种截留肯定会改变信息，以至于使人能够辨认，这就意味着信息接收者因此会明白此消息已不安全。事实惊人但没有错，这种现场基于粒子，粒子带有可识别属性，这些属性可被同一时间内得以创造，使得粒子缠绕，那么无论距离多远，这些属性就不会在不改变其他属性的同时遭到人所改变。

Researchers in several countries have experimented with the idea of quantum encryption, with some success. They have sent quantum-entangled messages through optical fibres, and also through the air, as packets of light. This approach, though, suffers from the fact that the signal is absorbed by the medium through which it is passing. The farthest that a quantum signal can be sent through an optical fibre, for example, is about 100km. Sending one farther than that would require the invention of quantum repeaters, devices that could receive, store and re-transmit quantum information securely. Such repeaters are theoretically possible, but so technologically complex that they remain impossible in practice.

根据这种量子加密的想法，几个国家的研究者进行了试验，获得了一些成功。这些研究者使用光纤也使用了空气将量子缠结的信息以光束形式发送出去。不过这种方法失败了，原因是有这样一个事实：信号在通过介质途中会被介质吸收。举个例子，一个能经光纤传送的量子信号，其传送最远距离达100千米。若想远于100千米，这就需要发明出量子连发枪，量子连发枪是能接收，储存并且重新安全发送量子信息的装置。这种量子连发枪理论上可行，但是技术上十分复杂，因此它们现在仍在实践上不可行。
