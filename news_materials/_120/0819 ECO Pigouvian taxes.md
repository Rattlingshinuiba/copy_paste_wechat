> LOUD conversation in a train carriage that makes concentration impossible for fellow-passengers. A farmer spraying weedkiller that destroys his neighbour’s crop. Motorists whose idling cars spew fumes into the air, polluting the atmosphere for everyone. Such behaviour might be considered thoughtless, anti-social or even immoral. For economists these spillovers are a problem to be solved.

在火车车厢大声喧哗会使同车乘客集中注意力的可能性为零，一位农夫喷洒除草剂会毁了邻居家的庄稼，司机驾驶的汽车不前进时往空气中排放尾气，污染大气，波及所有人。如此之行为可能让人觉得不为他人着想，反社会，甚至不道德。对经济学家来说，这些产生的副作用结果是一种尚须解决的难题。

> Markets are supposed to organise activity in a way that leaves everyone better off. But the interests of those directly involved, and of wider society, do not always coincide. Left to their own devices, boors may ignore travellers’ desire for peace and quiet; farmers the impact of weedkiller on the crops of others; motorists the effect of their emissions. In all of these cases, the active parties are doing well, but bystanders are not. Market prices—of rail tickets, weedkiller or petrol—do not take these wider costs, or “externalities”, into account.

人们认为市场策划活动，使每人都能受益。然而其中直接涉及到的人们利益与广义社会之间的利益并不一直达到协调。粗鲁的人自顾自己，忽视旅客想要的和平宁静；农夫忽视除草剂对他人作物的影响；司机影响尾气排放的后果。在所有的这些例子中，主动方做得不错，但旁观者做得不行。火车票价，除草剂和汽油的价钱，即市场价格，没有把这些更广义上的消耗——或者说是“externalities”——给考虑在内。
